When using ssh keys for authentication, the keys need to be generated using ``RSA`` as the algorithm  and with ``no passphrase``.

Crafter requires the key to be ``RSA`` and does not support keys generated using an algorithm other than ``RSA``.  The Jsch library that Jgit uses only supports ``RSA`` and does not support other keys such as OpenSSH. Crafter also currently doesn't support using a passphrase with SSH keys.

To generate your Secure Shell (SSH) keys for authentication, run the following command ``ssh-keygen -m PEM -b 4096 -t rsa``.  Your output should look something like this:

.. code-block:: sh

    âœ— ssh-keygen -m PEM -b 4096 -t rsa
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa):
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in /Users/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /Users/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    .
    .

Check that the file starts with the following header: ``-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`` to verify that the key is using ``RSA``.

After generating your private and public keys, you will need to add your new public key to where your remote git repository is located.  If you are using GitHub, you will need to add your public key (e.g., ``id_rsa.pub``) into your GitHub account.  If your remote Git repository is hosted on a server, you will need to copy your public key (e.g., ``id_rsa.pub``) to the host server.
