CrafterCMS plugins extend the CMS and provide the users additional functionality.  It allows developers to create new experiences both for authors and end-users.  Plugins can be a single file or multiple files and directories.

Developers may submit their plugins to the :ref:`CrafterCMS Marketplace <newIa-marketplace>`, which provides a home for the Crafter community to contribute, find, and use plugins.
