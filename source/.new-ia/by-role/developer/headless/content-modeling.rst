Content Modeling
================

Every content object in CrafterCMS is an object associated with a Content Model. Content Models allow you to add
structure to your content and facilitate consumption via various visual representations or via APIs. One of the
great things about CrafterCMS content models is that your content can be semi-structured which allows content
authors the freedom to be as creative as they'd like to be, but provide the template/UI and API developers enough
structure to produce solid multi-channel renditions of the content.

See :ref:`here <newIa-content-modeling>` for a walk through of Content Type management in Crafter Studio to help
you create the models that best fit your requirements.
