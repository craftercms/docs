CrafterCMS comes configured with default settings allowing us to run the available blueprints out of the box.  The default settings are a starting point but needs to be reviewed to verify if those settings are applicable to the experience being created.  Some of the settings that may be modified are related to features or system performance and others may be optional features.

This section contains information on how to configure the different settings in CrafterCMS. Changes to configuration settings are managed mostly using Crafter Studio.


Here are settings that can be configured for your CrafterCMS experience.
