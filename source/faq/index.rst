------------------------------------
Can Crafter CMS be used as a portal?
------------------------------------
Yes. Crafter is running portals for some of the most well known companies in the world.  Use cases include intranets, global extranets, B2B portals, B2E portals and B2C portals in hospitality, finance, logistics, education and telcom and many others.

Many people hear the word portal and immediately search for a "portal" technology that meets the JSR-268 standard.  Crafter does not support JSR-268 natively.  We do integrate with Liferay Portal and have been deployed in cases where stronger WCM capabilities were required than what Liferay provides out of the box. 

You only need JSR-268 if you want to build and deploy your application as "portlets."  Doing so certainly has some advantages like the ability to leverage different application stacks for different applications in the portal.  However, from an IT management perspective, unless there is good justification for different technology, doing so creates issues with technology management and total cost of ownership.
