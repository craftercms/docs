Example
-------

Here's an example of issuing the ``add-environment`` command to setup the connection to CrafterCMS.  We'll use ``local`` for the name, ``http://localhost:8080`` for the url, and a token for the authentication.  (See :ref:`here <access-tokens>` for the steps on how to create a token.)  Leave the token blank, you will be prompted for the token after issuing the ``add-environment`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   ➜  ./crafter-cli add-environment -e local -u http://localhost:8080 --token
   Enter value for --token (The access token for authentication):
   Environment added

|

If you're using HTTP basic for authentication when issuing the ``add-environment`` command, use ``username`` and ``password`` for the authentication.  Remember to enable the flag for HTTP basic auth to enable using the ``username`` and ``password`` for authentication as described :ref:`here <http-basic-authentication>`.

We'll use ``local`` for the name, ``http://localhost:8080`` for the url, and ``john`` for the username.  Leave the password blank, you will be prompted for the password after issuing the ``add-environment`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    ➜  ./crafter-cli add-environment -e local -u http://localhost:8080 --username john --password
    Enter value for --password (The password for authentication):
    Environment added
