Simple Delivery Kubernetes Deployment
=====================================

A Kubernetes deployment describes an applications life cycle, e.g. images to be used, the number of pods, etc. It creates pods based on a specified template.  CrafterCMS has an example Kubernetes deployment for a simple delivery.  In this section, we'll take a look at this example Kubernetes deployment.

.. TODO: Update screens and text once https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/5285 is done

|

   .. note::
      This section needs an update once the kubernetes deployment files are updated `here <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/5285>`__

------------
Requirements
------------

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the ``kubectl`` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your
cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube:
https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube.

The nodes in your cluster should at least have 4 CPUs and 8 GB of space, to avoid performance issues and out of memory
errors. In Minikube, to start a node with this characteristics, you can run a command similar to the following:
``minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 8192``.

In addition to that, we need the following:

* `k9s <https://k9scli.io/>`__ for viewing the status of the pods, the logs, etc
* An Authoring pod with a project published to ``live`` to pull project content from.
  To setup an authoring pod, you can follow  :ref:`newIa-setup-simple-authoring-with-kubernetes-deployment` or :ref:`newIa-setup-studio-clustering-with-kubernetes-deployment`.  Take note of the keys used in your Authoring setup.  We will be using the same ssh keys for our simple delivery setup.
  For this guide, we will use a simple Authoring with a single instance Kubernetes deployment to pull project content from.

* Kubernetes deployment files for CrafterCMS Simple Delivery, found here: https://github.com/craftercms/kubernetes-deployments/

     .. code-block:: sh

        ➜ git clone https://github.com/craftercms/kubernetes-deployments.git

  The deployment files that we need for our example is under the ``kubernetes-deployments/delivery/simple`` folder::

      kubernetes-deployments/delivery/simple
         resources/
            config/
               studio/
                  studio-config-override.yaml
            secrets/
               .ssh/
                  config
         authoring-deployment.yaml
         kustomization.yaml

------------------------
Setup Kubernetes Secrets
------------------------

From https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/

.. code-block:: text

   "Kubernetes Secrets let you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys."

|

The deployment files cloned from https://github.com/craftercms/kubernetes-deployments/ has a folder set aside for placing confidential information, ``kubernetes-deployments/delivery/simple/resources/secrets``

We'll need SSH access to the Authoring pod/s to pull project content. We'll be copying over the contents of the ``.ssh`` folder of your Authoring setup.

The guides :ref:`newIa-setup-simple-authoring-with-kubernetes-deployment` and :ref:`newIa-setup-studio-clustering-with-kubernetes-deployment` have details on how to setup an Authoring pod, where an SSH public/private key pair for authentication is generated and provided as a Kubernetes secret to the pods.

First, we'll go to the ``.ssh`` folder of our simple delivery deployment, then copy over the contents of the ``.ssh`` folder in the Authoring setup.

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜ cd kubernetes-deployments/delivery/simple/resources/secrets/.ssh
      ➜ cp kubernetes-deployments/authoring/simple/resources/secrets/.ssh/* .

--------------------
Start the Deployment
--------------------

Go to ``kubernetes-deployments/delivery/simple`` then run ``kubectl apply -k .``

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  kubectl apply -k .
      secret/delivery-ssh-keys-868d5g494k created
      service/delivery-service-headless created
      statefulset.apps/delivery created

Check the status of the deployments by running ``kubectl get deployments``, and the status of the Pods by running ``kubectl get pods``.  Here's a sample output when running ``kubectl get pods``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  simple git:(support/3.1.x) kubectl get pods
      NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
      authoring-0   4/4     Running   0          116m
      delivery-0    3/3     Running   0          8m55s
      delivery-1    3/3     Running   0          6m13s

Note that for the sample simple delivery Kubernetes deployment, two delivery pods are setup and for the simple authoring deployment, only one authoring pod is setup.

Another way of checking the status of the deployments/pods/etc. is by running ``k9s`` on the command line, which will open up a text-based user interface:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜ k9s

   |

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/simple-delivery-k9s-start.webp
   :alt: CrafterCMS Simple Delivery Kubernetes Deployment
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

|

Once it comes up, you will see the new pod created.

You can tail the logs of the ``tomcat`` and ``deployer`` containers, with the ``kubectl`` command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      kubectl logs -f -c CONTAINER_NAME POD_NAME

For example: ``kubectl logs -f -c tomcat delivery-0``

To view the logs in a pod using k9s, from the ``Pods`` view, select the pod you would like to view the logs of using your keyboard arrow keys, then hit enter to view the containers in the pod.

   :alt: Simple Delivery Kubernetes deployments - k9s container views
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

|

We'll take a look at the tomcat logs, so, we'll move the cursor to the ``tomcat`` container, then press the letter ``l``.

---------------------------------
Bootstrap the Project in Delivery
---------------------------------
Now you need to setup the project in Delivery. If you don’t know the name of the Delivery Pod yet, run ``kubectl get pods`` and check for the one that has a name like delivery-XX. Then, run the following command (remember to replace the pod name and the project name with the actual values):

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜ kubectl exec -it DELIVERY_POD_NAME --container deployer -- gosu crafter ./bin/init-site.sh SITE_NAME ssh://authoring-service/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/SITE_NAME/published

This command will create the Deployer project target and create the index in Elasticsearch.

.. include:: /includes/ssh-private-key.rst

After a minute or two, the Deployer should have pulled the project content from Authoring (you can check it by getting the Delivery Deployer log: ``kubectl logs -c deployer DELIVERY_POD_NAME``).

Here's the output when we setup the project in the ``delivery-1`` pod:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  kubectl exec -it delivery-1 --container deployer -- gosu crafter ./bin/init-site.sh mysite ssh://authoring-service/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/mysite/published

      Creating Deployer Target...
      Target created successfully

   |

To setup the project in Delivery using ``k9s``, from the ``Pods`` view, select the Delivery pod you would like to setup using your keyboard arrow keys, then hit enter to view the containers in the pod.  Move the cursor to the ``deployer`` container, then press ``s`` to open a shell to the deployer.

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/simple-delivery-k9s-deployer-shell.webp
   :alt: Simple Delivery Kubernetes deployments - k9s deployer shell opened
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

|

We'll switch to user ``crafter`` first by  running the command ``gosu crafter bash``

   .. code-block:: bash

      <<K9s-Shell>> Pod: default/delivery-0 | Container: deployer
      root@delivery-0:/opt/crafter# gosu crafter bash
      crafter@delivery-0:/opt/crafter$

Next, we'll run the ``init-site.sh`` script to create the deployer target.  Go to the ``bin`` folder, then run ``init-site.sh SITENAME  ssh://authoring-service/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/SITENAME/published``

   .. code-block:: bash

      crafter@delivery-0:/opt/crafter$ cd bin
      crafter@delivery-0:/opt/crafter/bin$ ./init-site.sh mysite ssh://authoring-service/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/mysite/published
      Creating Deployer Target...
      Target created successfully

.. include:: /includes/ssh-private-key.rst

You can check the deployer logs to verify that the target has been created. From the ``Pods`` view, select the Delivery pod you're working on, then hit enter to view the containers in the pod. Move the cursor to the ``deployer`` container, then press ``l`` to open the deployer logs.

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/simple-delivery-k9s-deployer-logs.webp
   :alt: Simple Delivery Kubernetes deployments - k9s deployer log opened

We can now access the project in Delivery.

To be able to access applications in Kubernetes, we need to use port forwarding.  To access the project in Delivery, we will forward a local port to the tomcat port in the pod.  We will forward a local port to the ``tomcat`` container in the pod.

``kubectl port-forward`` allows using resource name, such as a pod name, to select a matching pod to port forward to.  To forward a local port to a port of a pod, run the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      kubectl port-forward pods/POD_NAME LOCAL_PORT:POD_PORT

Here's an example forwarding local port ``9081`` to the tomcat port in the ``delivery-1`` pod:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  kubectl port-forward pods/delivery-1 9081:8080
      Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9081 -> 8080
      Forwarding from [::1]:9081 -> 8080

   |

To forward a local port to the tomcat port in a pod using k9s, from the ``Pods`` view, select the pod you would like to port forward to using your keyboard arrow keys, then hit enter to view the containers in the pod.  We'll forward the local port to the tomcat port, so, we'll move the cursor to the ``tomcat`` container, then press ``<shift> + f``.  A dialog  will then open where you can enter the desired local port and address to use for port forwarding

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/simple-delivery-k9s-port-forward.webp
   :alt: Simple Delivery Kubernetes deployments - k9s port forward
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

|

Change the value of ``Local Port`` to your desired value.  For our example, we're using local port ``9080`` for the ``delivery-0`` pod.  After making desired changes, move the cursor to ``Ok`` then hit the enter key to save your changes.

We can now view the project in Delivery from the pod by entering ``localhost:9080?crafterSite=mysite`` or ``localhost:9081?crafterSite=mysite`` in your browser.

Also, when making a change in Authoring and publishing it, the change will be reflected in Delivery after a minute.
