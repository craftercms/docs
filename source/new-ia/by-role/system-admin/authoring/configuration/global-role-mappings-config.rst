Default Global Role

CrafterCMS comes with a predefined global role ``system_admin`` out of the box.

Users with the ``system_admin`` role have access to everything in the CMS such as all the modules in the Main Menu for managing users, groups, etc., all the sites and configuration files, creating/editing layouts, templates, taxonomies, content types, scripts, etc. in addition to creating and editing content, as well as the ability to approve and reject workflow.

See :ref:`newIa-global-permission-mappings-config` for more information on all items accessible for the ``system_admin`` role.
