Places Search Indexing Can Get Hung Up
--------------------------------------

* Communication Between Crafter Studio & Crafter Deployer

	* Crafter Studio will notify the Deployer when content has changed.
	* Ensure that the Deployer is pulling the changes.
	* If the Deployer is not receiving any changes, check network connectivity and ports.

* Communication Between Crafter Deployer & Elasticsearch

	* The Deployer has a target with a Search Processor.
	* Ensure that the processor is configured to the proper HOST, PORT for Elasticsearch.

* Communication Between Crafter Engine & Elasticsearch

	* Crafter Engine is configured to talk to Elasticsearch
	* Ensure that Crafter Engine is configured to the proper HOST, PORT for Elasticsearch.

Reviewing Log Files
-------------------

In order to figure out which of the possible failures described in the previous section happened,
you should review the following log files for each one of the components:

+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
|| Component        || Log Files                                        |
+===================+===================================================+
|| Crafter Studio   || ``CRAFTER/logs/tomcat/catalina.out``             |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
|| Crafter Deployer || ``CRAFTER/logs/deployer/deployer.out``           |
||                  || ``CRAFTER/logs/deployer/deployer-general.log``   |
||                  || ``CRAFTER/logs/deployer/{target}-{env}.log``     |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
|| Elasticsearch    || ``CRAFTER/logs/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log`` |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
|| Crafter Engine   || ``CRAFTER/logs/tomcat/catalina.out``             |

--------------------------------------------
Configure Deployer Port & Elasticsearch Port
--------------------------------------------

``CRAFTER/bin/crafter-setenv.sh``

.. code-block:: bash

  export DEPLOYER_PORT=${DEPLOYER_PORT:="9191"}

  export ES_HOST=${ES_HOST:="localhost"}
  export ES_PORT=${ES_PORT:="9201"}

Elasticsearch Storage Monitoring
--------------------------------

Please note the following default behavior of Elasticsearch monitoring the available storage:

* Will not allocate shards to nodes that have more than 85% disk used (only affects clusters not single instances)
* Will attempt to relocate shards away from a node whose disk usage is above 90% (only affects clusters, not single instances)
* Enforces read-only on every index that has one or more shards allocated on the node that has at least one disk exceeding 95% (affects any intance)

When an index is set as read-only the application log will show messages similar to this one

.. code-block:: none

   Caused by: ElasticsearchStatusException[Elasticsearch exception [type=cluster_block_exception, reason=blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];]]

|

In the Elasticsearch log the following message will be shown:

.. code-block:: none

   [2019-04-02T16:10:14,520][WARN ][o.e.c.r.a.DiskThresholdMonitor] [uKHC0qA] flood stage disk watermark [95%] exceeded on [uKHC0qAFSrWZguNmsWhFiQ][uKHC0qA][INSTALL_DIR/data/indexes-es/nodes/0] free: 10.5gb[4.5%], all indices on this node will be marked read-only
