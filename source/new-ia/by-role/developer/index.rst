This section focuses on how to build content rich applications backed by CrafterCMS.  It covers
the basic topics you need to define a content type and render that content as part of a page,
component or service.  It also covers topics like building queries, accessing services and extending
the core platforms and the developer workflow (DevContentOps).

Developers need to be comfortable with Content Modeling (how to represent content in CrafterCMS
for your application to retrieve said content), and how to access content items from your application/project.

The following gets you started with content modeling, content retrieval, and more:

CrafterCMS also supports content inheritance out of the box, and supports it via a pluggable mechanism
that allows developers to augment or override what’s out of the box. Below is more information on
content inheritance:

To search for content in your project:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :titlesonly:

CrafterCMS allows content targeting by providing the ability to render content adapted to specific users,
depending on different aspects like geographical location, language, preferences, etc.

While developing your project, there are times when you’d like to see more log details, to figure out what
is happening and address it as needed.  Overriding the logging levels allows you to see more or less
details depending on your needs.

CrafterCMS supports content authoring, publishing and developer workflow and how to configure
and implement it, the basic mechanics of DevContentOps.

The following looks at the developer workflow in depth:
