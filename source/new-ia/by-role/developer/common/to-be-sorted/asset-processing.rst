Asset Processing
================

Most projects contains images that are viewed in different display sizes (desktops/laptops, mobile phones,
tablets, of which comes in different sizes, etc.).  To ensure the same experience on your project through
various display sizes, the images would need to be converted to different sizes and formats.  CrafterCMS
supports automatic image processing that allows you to upload just one image that gets converted to the
different sizes or formats required by your project for various display sizes.  This automatic image
processing is one form of asset processing and can be configured in Studio through the **Asset Processing**
configuration file.

Asset processing allows you to define transformations for static assets (currently only images), through a
series of processor pipelines that are executed when the assets are uploaded to Studio.  A processor is an
application that can manipulate your assets to your desired formats such as compress and optimize JPEG and
PNG images, etc.  Each processor pipeline in the configuration let's you manipulate the asset to a desired
format/size.  You can specify just one or as many processors as needed.  You can also specify just one or as
many pipelines as required by your project. (Say, you want an image appropriate for mobile devices and an image
appropriate for desktop browsers, you'll have two pipelines setup in the configuration.)

----------------------------
Configuring Asset Processing
----------------------------

The pipelines can be configured by going to the Sidebar in Studio, then from the Sidebar, go to
``Project Tools > Configurations > Asset Processing``.   Each pipeline has the following structure:

.. code-block:: xml

    <pipeline>
      <inputPathPattern/>
      <keepOriginal/>
      <processors>
        <processor>
          <type/>
          <params/>
          <outputPathFormat/>
        </processor>
      </processors>
    </pipeline>

|

**Where:**

- ``inputPathPattern:`` regex that the assets need to match in order to be processed by the pipeline. Groups that are
  captured by this regex are available later to the ``outputPathFormat``.
- ``keepOriginal (optional):`` if the original asset (without changes) should be saved.
- ``type:`` the type of the processor. Right now 2 types are supported: ``ImageMagickTransformer`` and
  ``TinifyTransformer``:

    - ``ImageMagickTransformer``: runs ImageMagick from the command line, with ``params.options`` as the command line
      params [#]_.
    - ``TinifyTransformer``: uses the Java client of TinyPNG to compress JPEG/PNG images [#]_.

- ``outputPathFormat (optional)``: the format of the output path. Variables that have a dollar sign ($) and an index
  are later replaced by groups that resulted during input path matching, to form the final output path. If not
  specified, then the same input path is used as the output path.

.. note::
    Please note the following:

    - We currently support 2 types of image processors, **ImageMagickTransformer** and **TinifyTransformer**
    - You can have one or multiple pipelines setup, but, a pipeline must have at least one processor configured.

Asset Processing Example
------------------------

The following example specifies 2 different asset processing pipelines: the first one converts any image put
under ``/static-assets/images/upload/`` into another one that's compressed and suitable to be displayed in a desktop
browser, while the second one converts the same image for display on mobile devices:

.. code-block:: xml

  <assetProcessing>
      <pipelines>

          <!-- Web transformer pipeline -->
          <pipeline>
              <inputPathPattern>^/static-assets/images/upload/(.+)\.jpg$</inputPathPattern>
              <keepOriginal>false</keepOriginal>
              <processors>
                  <processor>
                      <type>ImageMagickTransformer</type>
                      <params>
                          <options>-level 0,100%,1.3 -gaussian-blur 0.05 -quality 20% -strip</options>
                      </params>
                      <outputPathFormat>/static-assets/images/compressed/web/$1-compressed.jpg</outputPathFormat>
                  </processor>
              </processors>
          </pipeline>

          <!-- Mobile transformer pipeline -->
          <pipeline>
              <inputPathPattern>^/static-assets/images/upload/(.+)\.jpg$</inputPathPattern>
              <keepOriginal>false</keepOriginal>
              <processors>
                  <processor>
                      <type>ImageMagickTransformer</type>
                      <params>
                          <options>-level 0,100%,1.3 -gaussian-blur 0.05 -quality 20% -strip -resize 226x164</options>
                      </params>
                      <outputPathFormat>/static-assets/images/compressed/mobile/$1-compressed.png</outputPathFormat>
                  </processor>
                  <processor>
                      <type>TinifyTransformer</type>
                  </processor>
              </processors>
          </pipeline>

      </pipelines>
  </assetProcessing>

Using the above example, if an image called ``logo.jpg`` would be put under ``/static-assets/images/upload``,
Studio would generate 2 files: the web version, under ``/static-assets/images/compressed/web/logo-compressed.jpg``,
and the mobile version, under ``/static-assets/images/compressed/mobile/logo-compressed.png``. The original file
would be discarded.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] You need to have image ImageMagick installed in the machine, with the ``convert`` command in the path.  For more information on ImageMagick options, please see https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php
.. [#] The Tinify API key must be specified in the ``studio-config-overrides.yaml`` file (found in your Authoring installation, under ``shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension``).  Add the line below and remember to replace ``<your Tinify API key>`` with the actual value of your Tinify API key:
       ``studio.configuration.asset.processing.tinify.apiKey:<your Tinify API key>``.  For more information on Tinify, please see https://tinypng.com/developers/reference/java
