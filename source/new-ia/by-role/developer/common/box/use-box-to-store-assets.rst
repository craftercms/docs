=======================
Use Box to store assets
=======================

Box is a great option when you need to store media and documents that are quite large. The following guide explains how to:

* Configure Studio to use Box.
* Upload documents to Box using the ``box-file-upload`` control in Studio.
* Generate public links in Engine that users can use to access these documents.

-------------
Prerequisites
-------------

* Create a Box profile to upload the assets.
* Create a project based on the Editorial blueprint.

-------------------------------------------
Step 1: Add the Box configuration in Studio
-------------------------------------------

Go to |projectTools| > ``Configuration`` and in the dropdown select Box Profiles. If you click on View Sample, you’ll see the available configuration profiles. In particular, the configuration for a Box profile is the following:

.. code-block:: xml
    :linenos:

    <profile>
        <id/>
        <clientId/>
        <clientSecret/>
        <enterpriseId/>
        <publicKeyId/>
        <privateKey/>
        <privateKeyPassword/>
        <uploadFolder/>
    </profile>

|

**where:**

* **id:** the ID that ``box-file-upload`` controls will use to refer to this profile.
* **clientId:** Box client id
* **clientSecret:** Box client secret
* **enterpriseId:** Box enterprise id
* **publicKeyId:** Box public key id
* **privateKey:** Actual private key text in a CDATA
* **privateKeyPassword:** Password used to decrypt the private key (passphrase)
* **uploadFolder:** Name of the folder where files will be uploaded in Box

For this guide, the Box Profiles should look like this (replace the ``...``'s for actual Box credentials and ``videos`` for the actual upload folder where you’re storing the documents):

.. code-block:: xml
    :linenos:

    <box>
      <box>
        <profile>
          <id>box-default</id>
          <clientId>...</clientId>
          <clientSecret>...</clientSecret>
          <enterpriseId>...</enterpriseId>
          <publicKeyId>...</publicKeyId>
          <privateKey>
    <![CDATA[...]]>
          </privateKey>
          <privateKeyPassword>...</privateKeyPassword>
          <uploadFolder>videos</uploadFolder>
        </profile>
      </box>
    </box>

|

------------------------------------------
Step 2: Enable the Box File Upload Control
------------------------------------------

In |projectTools| > Configuration > Project Config Tools, in the <controls> section, enable the Box File Upload by adding the following lines:

.. code-block:: xml
    :linenos:

    <control>
      <name>box-file-upload</name>
      <icon>
        <class>fa-square-o</class>
        <stackedclass>fa-upload</stackedclass>
      </icon>
    </control>

|

-----------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Add the Box File Upload Control to the content type
-----------------------------------------------------------

For our example, we'll add an ``Attachments`` field, which is of type ``box-file-upload``, to the ``Article``
content type. To do this:

#. Go to ``Project Tools`` and open the ``Article`` content type definition.
#. At the end of the *Content* section, add a ``Box File Upload`` control with Title *Attachments* and Name *attachments* (the control has a property called Profile ID. If you changed the name of ``profile.id`` in step 1, you need to change it in the property too).  Remember to put a check mark on the ``Enable Upload`` and ``Enable Multiple Selection`` properties of the **Box File Upload** control so the users will be able to upload assets to Box and be able to select multiple assets.

    :align: center

----------------------------------------------
Step 4: Add Freemarker code to render the URLs
----------------------------------------------

We need to add the Freemarker code that will render the URLs. In the ``Templates`` > ``web`` > ``pages`` > ``article.ftl``, add the following lines after the ``<#list contentModel.sections.item as item>...</#list>`` lines:

.. code-block:: html
  :force:

  <#if contentModel.attachments??>
     <h2>Attachments</h2>
     <ul>
       <#list contentModel.attachments.item as a>
         <li><a href="${a.url}">${a.name}</a></li>
       </#list>
     </ul>
  </#if>

-------------------------------------------------
Step 5: Add some attachments and test the changes
-------------------------------------------------

If all the previous steps have been done correctly, you should be able to add any number of attachments and they
should appear underneath the last content sections when the page is rendered. To upload files to Box, click on the ``+`` button in the Box widget and select ``Upload``, then drag or browse for the files you want to upload.  Click on the ``Upload`` button after selecting the files you want to upload.  After the upload finishes, click on the ``Close`` button on the left side of the Box widget and you'll be able to see the files you just uploaded to Box.  You'd then put a check mark next to the files that you want to add as attachment for the page, then click on the ``Choose`` button.

For example, after adding a couple of PDF catalogs in the *Men Styles For Winter* article:

.. image:: /_static/images/guides/box/attachments-form.webp
   :alt: Box Assets - Attachments Form
   :align: center

|

The bottom of the page looks like this when you preview your page:

.. image:: /_static/images/guides/box/attachments-view.webp
   :alt: Box - Attachments View
   :align: center

|

---------------------------
Step 6: Publish the changes
---------------------------

The next step is to publish the changes.  Remember to publish not just the page where we added the Box assets,
but also the ``article.ftl`` and the ``box.xml`` files too.
