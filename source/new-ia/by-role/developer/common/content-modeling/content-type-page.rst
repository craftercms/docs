Page Content Type
=================

Page content types are top level container types that lets you define the layout/structure and functionality of content/components.  To create a new page content type, click on |projectTools| from the **Sidebar**

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-site-config.webp
	:alt: Template Project Config
	:align: center

|

Click on **Content Types**, then select **Create New Type**

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-create-new-type.webp
    :alt: Template Create New Type
    :align: center
    :width: 50%

|

Enter a Display Label and content type name for your new page content type, then select **Page** as Type and then click on the **Create** button

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-create-new-filled.webp
    :alt: Template Create New Type Dialog
    :align: center
    :width: 35%

|

We'll now start to construct the layout of the page.  A content type has three ingredients: the model, the view and the controller.

^^^^^
Model
^^^^^

We'll start building the model first, which is the form that Authors will be using to enter content into.  We'll add a form section called *Content* to the form and name it accordingly.

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-add-form-section.webp
	:alt: Template Add Form Section to Model
	:align: center

|

We'll add a few more things to our model by dragging controls and data sources to the form.  We're creating a page template for a blog entry, so at a minimum, we'll add some input fields for the title and author names, a date/time field, an image picker and it's corresponding data sources and a rich text editor inside a repeating group control so Authors can add as many sections as they want.

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-add-controls-input.webp
	:alt: Template Add Input Fields to the Form
	:align: center

|

Here we're adding an image picker to the form.  Notice that we'll need to add data sources for the image picker to get images from.  There are at least two sources that the image picker can get images from.  One is from images uploaded from the desktop, the other is for existing images listed in the **Static Assets** folder in the **Sidebar**.

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-add-image-picker.webp
	:alt: Template Add Image Picker to Form
	:align: center

|

We're now going to add a data source for our image picker, by dragging the **Image Uploaded from Desktop** from the Data Sources list on the right to the form in the section **Data Sources**.  Don't forget to enter the path where to store the new image uploaded from desktop in the **Repository Path** field under the Properties Explorer

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-image-desktop-src.webp
	:alt: Template Add Desktop Image Source
	:align: center

|

We'll also add the data source **Image From Repository** by dragging it to the **Data Sources** section in the form.  Don't forget to add the path where to browse existing images from the repository

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-image-existing-src.webp
	:alt: Template Add Existing Image Source
	:align: center

|

We'll go back to the Image Picker control on the form to make sure the two data sources we added are checked as sources for the Image Picker

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-add-img-src.webp
	:alt: Template Add Image Sources to Image Picker
	:align: center

|

We'll be adding a header component and a left-rail component inherited from the home page.  To add a component to the form, drag the **Item Selector** control to the form in the *Page - Blog Properties* section.  We'll be adding two components to the form, one for the *Header* and one for the *Left-rail*

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-add-item-selector.webp
	:alt: Template Add Item Selector
	:align: center

|

We'll need to add a data source for the two *Item Selectors* we just added to the form by dragging **Shared Content** to the *Data Sources* section to the form and naming it **Components**. Don't forget to add the path where to store new content created under the **Repository Path** field in the Properties Explorer.

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-add-item-selector-src.webp
	:alt: Template Add Item Selector Source
	:align: center

|


We're going back to the Item Selectors we added to the form and check  **Components** as data source for our control

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-add-item-sel-src.webp
	:alt: Template Check Item Selector Source
	:align: center

|

Next we'll add a **Repeating Group** control to the form,  with a minimum of 1 occurrence, which can be specified in the *Properties Explorer* section, in the **Minimum Occurrences** field

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-add-repeating-group.webp
	:alt: Template Add Repeating Group Control
	:align: center

|

In the Repeating Group control, we will add an RTE (Rich Text Editor).  In order for the content to be searchable, it needs to be indexed.  To facilitate indexing, the suffix **_html** should be appended to the variable name given to the RTE.  In this case, the RTE's variable name is *entry_html*.  For more information on variable names and search indexing , please see the section :ref:`newIa-form-control-variable-names`

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-add-rte.webp
	:alt: Template Add Rich Text Editor to Repeating Group Control
	:align: center

|

The model for our template is done.  You can add some other controls by dragging and dropping controls from the **Controls** section to the form.  To learn more about all the controls available, please see :ref:`newIa-form-controls`.  To learn more about the data sources available, please see :ref:`newIa-data-sources`.

^^^^
View
^^^^

We'll now build the view for our template, which is the freemarker template file that renders the content, typically to HTML markup.
There are two ways to create the freemarker template file for our template.  One way is to open the **Sidebar** menu in Studio, then navigate to the **Templates** folder, depending on how your project is setup, you may want to navigate to the subfolder in your Templates folder where you want to create the freemarker template file.  Once you are in the desired subfolder, right click on that folder then select **Create Template**

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-ftl-create-sidebar.webp
    :alt: Template Create FTL from Sidebar
    :align: center
    :width: 35%

|

The other way of creating your freemarker template, is to go to the Properties Explorer in the Content Type model, then click on the **Display Template** field, a magnifying glass and a pencil will appear on the field.  To create a template, click on the pencil.

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-ftl-create-properties.webp
	:alt: Template Create FTL from Content Type Properties Display Template Field
	:align: center

|

Either way of starting to create your new ftl template, a Create Template dialog will appear.  It will then ask you for a filename for the freemarker template you're creating, then click on the **Create** button.

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-ftl-create-dialog.webp
    :alt: Template FTL Create Template Dialog
    :align: center
    :width: 35%

|

A dialog will appear with a blank template.

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-ftl-dialog.webp
    :alt: Template FTL Dialog
    :width: 65%
    :align: center

|

At the top right of the dialog, you can use some *Template code examples* from a drop down list with the caption ``Insert Code``.  Here's the list of available template code examples.

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-ftl-sample-codes.webp
    :alt: Template FTL Code Examples
    :align: center
    :width: 35%

|

For the template we are creating, we will select **Studio support** from  the drop down list to enable authoring support.

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-ftl-studio-support-sample.webp
	:alt: Template FTL Studio Support Code Example
	:align: center

|

We will now start filling in the template of how we want the content captured in the model is rendered to html in this case.  In the image below, we render the header component and the other fields in the Content section of our model.  Please note how fields in the model are rendered through the FTL template.  To learn more, please see the section :ref:`newIa-templating-api`

      <section>
        <header class="main" <@studio.iceAttr iceGroup="subject"/>>
          <h1>${contentModel.subject!""}</h1>
          <h2>by ${contentModel.author!""}</h2>
        </header>
        <#if contentModel.image??>
          <#assign image = contentModel.image/>
        <#else>
          <#assign image = "/static-assets/images/placeholder.png"/>
        </#if>
        <span class="image main"><img src="${image}" alt="" /></span>
        <#list contentModel.entries.item as item>
          <div <@studio.iceAttr iceGroup="blog"/>>
            ${item.entry_html}
          </div>
          <hr class="major" />
        </#list>
      </section>

^^^^^^^^^^
Controller
^^^^^^^^^^

A controller is not necessary for a content type.  To show how to create a controller for our new content type, we will create a custom controller.  In the preceding section, we created a new content type (template) Page - Blog.  We will now add a couple of featured articles at the bottom of the page depending on the active segment set in targeting.  To be able to display articles depending on the active segment set, we will need to get a list of articles tagged for the active segment.  This can be done by adding a script that gets executed to get the list of articles tagged for the segment selected before the page is rendered.

Open the **Sidebar** menu and navigate to the **Scripts** folder.  Click on the **Scripts** folder then **scripts**.  Right click on the folder **pages**, then select **Create Controller**

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-create-controller.webp
    :alt: Template Create Controller
	:align: center
    :width: 35%

|

Enter a name for the controller, then click on the **Create** button.  Since we are creating this controller for our Page-Blog template, we will name the script ``blog.groovy``.  Putting the script under *scripts->pages* and naming it after the page content type, binds the script to our page.

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-dialog-create-controller.webp
    :alt: Template Dialog Create Controller
    :align: center
    :width: 45%

|

We can now start adding the script to get a list of articles depending on the active segment.

.. figure:: /_static/images/templates/templates-input-script-controller.webp
    :alt: Template Controller Script
	:align: center
    :width: 75%

.. code-block:: groovy
    :linenos:

    import org.craftercms.sites.editorial.SearchHelper
    import org.craftercms.sites.editorial.ProfileUtils

    def segment = ProfileUtils.getSegment(profile, siteItemService)
    def searchHelper = new SearchHelper(searchService, urlTransformationService)
    def articles = searchHelper.searchArticles(false, null, segment, 0, 2)

    templateModel.articles = articles

|

There are two ways to bind a script/controller to a page/component.  The first way, as we have seen is to put the script under Scripts->Pages or Scripts->Components, and name the script after the page or component type.  We'll show the other way how to bind a script to a page/component in the next section :ref:`newIa-content-type-component`

To find out more about page and component scripts, please see :ref:`newIa-page-and-component-scripts`.

Now that we have our controller, we just need to add code to the freemarker template (view) to display the list of articles returned by the script.

.. code-block:: html
    :force:
    :linenos:

    <section>
      <header class="major">
        <h2>Featured Articles</h2>
      </header>

      <div class="posts">
        <#list articles as article>
          <article>
            <a href="${article.url}" class="image">
              <#if article.image??>
                <#assign articleImage = article.image/>
              <#else>
                <#assign articleImage = "/static-assets/images/placeholder.png"/>
              </#if>
              <img src="${articleImage}" alt="" />
            </a>
            <h4><a href="${article.url}">${article.title}</a></h4>
            <p>${article.summary}</p>
            <ul class="actions">
              <li><a href="${article.url}" class="button">More</a></li>
            </ul>
          </article>
        </#list>
      </div>
    </section>

As you can see from the controller we just added, the controller is used to customize your page by enabling you to run codes before the page is rendered.  To find out more about groovy APIs in CrafterCMS, please see the section :ref:`newIa-groovy-api`.
