Search allows you to find objects in the system through keywords.  Each result is a content type of one sort or another.  An option to delete, edit/view and the content type is provided with each result.  You can view the results in a list or a grid, like below:

* Sort By
  * Relevance
  * Name
  * Width
  * Content Type
  * MIME Type
  * Content Size
  * Last Edit  Date
  * Height

* Path
* Width
* Content Type

**Result Selection**: Note the checkboxes for each result type .  Just as you can select multiple items on the dashboard and then interact with them in bulk, the same is true with search.  You will have checkboxes that allow you to choose many items and access to the context nav to take action on those items.  If you are selecting specific items for a control in a form you will be able to choose whatever number of items are expected by the control.
