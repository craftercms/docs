  including Recently Published and Approved Scheduled Items.

the projects you have been granted permission to.  From this screen you can navigate to any project.  Your projects
can be viewed either in a list or in a grid.

This screen is an overview of the workflow for that given project.  The project dashboard has different dashlets
depending on your role.

Each dashboard has a header

   Expand Collapse control.  Each widget can be closed and opened to hide the items shown by the widget.
   This setting is remembered by your browser

   Dashlet title and count.  Most dashlets include a count at the end of the name for the number of items in the widget

   Dashlet level options.  Options are different on each widget

   Show count.  Some dashlets allow the author to decide how many items they want to see in the dashlet

   Content "type" filter:  Some dashlets allow you to filter them by a broad content type (All, Pages, Components)

For the dashboard shown above, here are the dashlets listed:

    * Items Waiting for Approval
        * Shows all items currently in workflow
        * Viewable only to admins and publishers

    * Approved Scheduled Items
        * Shows all items approved for a specific scheduled deployment date
        * Viewable only to admins and publishers

    * Recently Published
        * Shows all items that have been previously deployed
        * Viewable only to admins and publishers

    * My Recent Activity
        * Shows all items recently modified by the current user
        * Viewable by all users

    * Icon Guide
        * The Icon guide is simply a legend to help authors and content managers with the iconography on
          the system. While it can be very complex to sum up the state and nature of content in a glance,
          Crafter Studio attempts to achieve a high level visual summary for each object icons. You will
          see these icons throughout the application whenever an object is presented to the user. The icon
          always shows the Current state of the object.
        * Describes the meaning of icons within Crafter Studio
        * Viewable by all users
        * The Icon guide breaks down icons in to their elements.  You have two basic elements which can
          be combined to form a specific icon: the item type and the worfkflow indicator.

            **Item Types**

            Item types are high level archetypes of content objects within the system.  These types and the
            iconography associated with them provide a basic classification of the type of object at a glance.

            |workflowPage|:	A page is exactly what you would expect, it's a URI addressable object that
            represents a web page or resource.

            |workflowComponent|: A component is an object that is generally not URI addressable on the project.
            Examples are objects like Banners, Touts, Sidebar content etc. Components are usually re-usable
            assets that can be assigned and shared across many pages.

            |workflowTaxonomy|: A taxonomy is an object the same as a component used for classifying items.

            Below is a list of all the other item types available:

             - |workflowCss|
             - |workflowFolder|
             - |workflowLevelDescriptor|
             - |workflowTemplateScript|
             - |workflowGroovy|
             - |workflowImage|
             - |workflowJavaScript|
             - |workflowJson|
             - |workflowHTML|
             - |workflowCss|
             - |workflowPlainText|
             - |workflowXML|
             - |workflowFont|
             - |workflowIcon|

            |
            |

            **Workflow States**

            Workflow States help authors and content managers understand at a glance what is going on with the
            content at a high level.  Is it Live?  Is it work in progress?  Is it currently checked out?
            In some sort of approval process?

            |workflowNeverPub|:	The content has never been pushed live. This helps authors quickly identify which objects that are in progress are already live and which ones are entirely new.

            |workflowEdited|: Edited means that the item has been edited since it was made live. Items move to edited as soon as they are created or when they are edited.

            |workflowDeleted|: Items which carry the red trash can icon but are not editable and previewable are deleted.  You will only see these items in dashboards which show historical data

            |workflowLocked|: A locked item is currently in the process of being edited by another author.

            |workflowProcessing|: Item is currently being handled by the system

            |workflowSubmittedForLive|: |br|
            |workflowSubmittedForStaging|: Any item which carries the airplane icon is in some sort of workflow

            |workflowScheduledForLive|: |br|
            |workflowScheduledForStaging|: Item has a launch schedule associated with it

            |workflowPublishing|: Item is currently being published

            |workflowDisabled|:	You will find that some objects have a red circle with a slash in the middle, this means that the object is not deleted but it should not be displayed on the project.  It's essentially a logical delete.  Imagine a scenario where you need to take an object down immediately because of an inaccuracy while you make corrections.  Disable is perfect for this and several other scenarios.

            **Publishing Status/Target**

            |publishStaging|: Item has been published to the ``staging`` publishing target

            |publishLive|: Item has been published to the ``live`` publishing target

    |
    |

    **Selecting a dashboard item**

        Dashboard items have the ability to be selected.  Selecting an item allows the user to interact with the
        selected items via the context navigation

        Items in the dashboard has a icons which shows the type and current workflow status of the item

        Clicking on ``Options`` (the three dots next to the item) shows the type and current workflow status of
         the item, plus all oprions available e.g. ``Edit``, ``Publish``, etc.
