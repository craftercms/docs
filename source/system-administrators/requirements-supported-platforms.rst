Requirements and Supported Platforms
====================================

This section describes CrafterCMS requirements and supported platforms.

------------
Requirements
------------

To run CrafterCMS, the following are required:

    - Java 1.8
    - 8+ Gig of memory to JVM (additional memory may be required depending on the size and number of your web experiences)

Additional requirements for running CrafterCMS are listed here :ref:`Installing and verifying prerequisites<installing-and-verifying-prerequisites>`

Please note that CrafterCMS does not require any external databases for the core system to run and deliver fully dynamic experiences.  MongoDB is used by Crafter Profile and Crafter Social which are optional components that provide user management and social features.

.. note:: CrafterCMS is not yet compatible with Java 1.11.  We are working on updating our code to make sure we are 100% compatible with the newest Java version.
