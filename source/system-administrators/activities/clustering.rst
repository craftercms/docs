==================================
Studio Clustering |enterpriseOnly|
==================================

Crafter Studio can be clustered for high-availability.

A node is a server running an instance of Crafter Studio and a cluster consists of two or more nodes.  In the image above, two Crafter Studio instances are clustered as primary and replica.

When setting up a Studio cluster, a specific node needs to be started first as a
reference point, then the other node/s can join and form the cluster. This is known as cluster bootstrapping.
Bootstrapping is the first step to introduce a node as Primary Component, which others will see as a reference
point to sync up with.

The Primary Component is a central concept on how to ensure that there is no opportunity for database inconsistency or
divergence between the nodes in case of a network split. The Primary Component is a set of nodes that communicate
with each other over the network and contains the majority of the nodes. There's no Primary Component yet when starting
up a cluster, hence the need of the first node to bootstrap the Component. The other nodes will then look for the
existing Primary Component to join.

   .. note::
      Studio nodes use an in-memory distributed data store to orchestrate the bootstrapping of the Primary Component, so
      you don't need to do it. When the cluster is started, the nodes synchronize through the data store to
      decide which one does the bootstrapping, and then the rest join the Primary Component.

Once the cluster is up, one node in the cluster is elected to be the primary and the rest of the node(s) as replica(s).

Requirements
------------

Before we begin configuring Studio for clustering, the following must be setup:

* A DNS server directing traffic to the primary node, and can failover to the replica node if the primary is not healthy

Configuring Studio Clustering
-----------------------------

First, we'll take a look at an example of how to setup a two node cluster with Studio step by step, then, we'll take a look at an example of setting up Studio clustering using a Kubernetes deployment
