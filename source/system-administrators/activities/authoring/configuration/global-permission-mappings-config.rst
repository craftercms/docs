Global Permission Mappings Config
=================================

The global permission mappings configuration file lets you configure the permissions to a role globally for the entire application

Permissions per project are managed within Crafter Studio's UI.  See :ref:`permission-mappings` for more information on project permissions.

Here's the default global permissions configuration.  It contains the permissions mappings for the roles defined in the :ref:`global role mappings configuration <global-role-mappings-config>` file.  To access the file, using your favorite editor, navigate to ``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/global/configuration/`` then open the file ``global-permission-mappings-config.xml``.  Remember to restart CrafterCMS so your changes to the file will take effect.

     This file contains global permissions configuration for Crafter Studio. Permissions per project are managed
     within Crafter Studio's UI.

     The structure of this file is:
     <permissions>
       <site id="###GLOBAL###"> (global management)
         <role name="">
           <rule regex="/.*">
             <allowed-permissions>
               <permission>Read</permission>
               <permission>Write</permission>
               <permission>Delete</permission>
               <permission>Create Folder</permission>
               <permission>Publish</permission>
             </allowed-permissions>
           </rule>
         </role>
       </site>
     </permissions>

     This binds a set of permissions to a role globally for the entire application.
