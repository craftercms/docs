Setup Crafter CMS Delivery Using Crafter's AWS AMI
==================================================

This section details how to setup Crafter CMS delivery using Crafter's AWS AMI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Launch an AWS EC2 instance using a Crafter CMS Delivery AMI
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Crafter provides a prebuilt AMI(s) for Crafter Engine, the delivery component of Crafter CMS. In this step we'll walk you through the initial launch of your instance. To get started, go to your EC2 dashboard and click ``Launch Instance`` AWS will prompt you to choose your AMI type/image.

You can find Crafter CMS Delivery by entering the keywords ``Crafter CMS Delivery`` in the search box as shown below. You will find a number of options in the search results.

* Crafter CMS Community Delivery is our open source version
* Crafter CMS Enterprise Delivery is our supported enterprise version

Click ``Select`` on the AMI type you want to use and then follow the launch instance/configuration wizard to determine the sizing and networking details for your instance. Please note, we recommend "C" class machines for best results with typical production use.

The launch instance wizard gives you the ability to tweak your instance's configuration details. In the next step we will connect to the machine with SSH via a terminal/console inorder to acquire the administrators initial login password for the Crafter Studio web application. You will need to add SSH to your inbound security settings for the instance to complete the next step and acquire the password. To do so, click the ``Configure Security Group`` tab.

To add the rule for SSH, click the ``Inbound traffic`` tab and then ``Add Rule`` to configure SSH. You can restrict the inbound traffic for SSH in the source column. To allow SSH from anywhere you can enter a CIDR of 0.0.0.0/0. Use the ports and IP masks/policies that align with your needs.

After clicking ``Launch``, AWS will request that you select a public key for administrative console access to the machine. You will need access to this key in the next step in order to retrieve the administrator's password for Crafter Studio. Create or choose an existing key and click ``Launch Instances``

---------------------------------------------
Step 2: Access the Crafter Engine via the Web
---------------------------------------------

In this step we want to prove that the application is up and running now that our instance has started and initialized fully. To do this, we're simply going to check that the application login screen shows up when we access it via a web browser.

To access the login screen open a web browser and navigate to http://DNS_NAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Configure Crafter Engine to deliver published sites
-----------------------------------------------------------

Crafter Engine is now up and running. However, in order to deliver content, its deployer must be configured to monitor a published repository for one or more sites. A delivery engine is multi-tenant and can deliver many sites. Each site must be configured or "initialized" such that the deployer monitors a Git repository for published updates. Crafter CMS's delivery tier has a decoupled, shared-nothing architecture that makes it cloud native and elastically scalable. You can read more about this architecture here: :ref:`architecture`

In this section we'll show you how to configure a Crafter Delivery instance to monitor a published Git repository and delivery content for a given site. The simplest topology for this is to directly monitor the published repository of a project on the authoring instance. This is what we will configure. Let's get started.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Step 3.1: Configure authoring instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to complete step 3, you must have a Crafter CMS authoring instance running.  If you do not, please follow these instructions to set an instance:

:ref:`setup-authoring-using-aws-ami`


After your authoring instance is set up and configured, follow this guide to create a simple site.
:ref:`your_first_website`

Crafter will automatically "publish" the initial state of the site for youfor you which will give you the prerequisites for the rest of step 3.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Step 3.2: Establish SSH-based communication between the delivery instance and the authoring instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The delivery instance's deployer can use any git protocol to communicate with the published repository. SSH is a secure method that is available with no additional set up. We'll use this approach. SSH requires authentication and the cleanest way to authenticate is via public / private keys. You may use existing key pairs but they must be RSA type keys. For completeness we'll generate and install keys from scratch.

3.2.1: Create a public / private key pair
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On your local machine, generate a public / private key pair.  On a terminal/console execute the following command:

.. code-block:: sh
   :linenos:

   ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa

You will be prompted for the file name and a passphrase. Since Crafter will use this key as part of an automated process, do not enter a passphase (just hit enter when prompted.)

Once the keygen process completes you should find a file at the location you specified. This is your private key.  You will find another file at the same location with a .pub extension.  This is your public key.

    :align: center
    :alt: Crafter CMS AWS AMI Delivery SSH RSA keygen

3.2.2: Install the public key on the authoring server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The next step is to upload and install our public key onto the authoring instance.

**Upload the public key to the authoring server**

You can upload the public key from your local machine to the authoring server by executing a file transfer via the scp command in a terminal window.

The command takes the following form: scp -i [PATH_TO_UBUNTU_USERS_PIVATE_KEY] [PATH_TO_GENERATED_PUBLIC_KEY] ubuntu@[DNS_NAME_OF_DELIVERY_INSTNCE]:~/crafter.pub

Example:

.. code-block:: sh
    :linenos:

    scp -i ~/user-test-aws.pem ~/Desktop/crafter.pub ubuntu@ec2-3-93-34-40.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/crafter.pub

**Install the public key on the authoring server**

The next step is to log in to the authoring server and install the public key into the crafter user's account.

To do this, SSH on to the authoring server as the ubuntu user and execute the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh
    :linenos:

    sudo mkdir -p /home/crafter/.ssh
    sudo touch /home/crafter/.ssh/authorized_keys
    sudo chown -R crafter:crafter /home/crafter/.ssh
    sudo su -
    cd /home/ubuntu/
    cat crafter.pub >> /home/crafter/.ssh/authorized_keys
    sudo chown -R crafter:crafter /home/crafter/.ssh
    sudo ls -al /home/crafter/.ssh
    exit

The **ls** command will help you verify that the key has been added to the authorized_keys file and that crafter is the owner of the file.  The output should look similar to the following:

.. code-block:: sh
    :linenos:

    total 12
    drwxr-xr-x 2 crafter crafter 4096 Apr 17 21:06 .
    drwxr-xr-x 3 crafter crafter 4096 Apr 17 21:06 ..
    -rw-r--r-- 1 crafter crafter 757 Apr 17 21:09 authorized_keys

3.2.3: Install the private key on the delivery server(s)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The next step is to upload and install our private key onto the delivery instance.

**Upload the private key to the delivery server**

You can upload the private key from your local machine to the delivery server by executing a file transfer via the scp command in a terminal window.

The command takes the following form: **scp -i [PATH_TO_UBUNTU_USERS_PIVATE_KEY] [PATH_TO_GENERATED_PRIVATE_KEY] ubuntu@[DNS_NAME_OF_DELIVERY_INSTNCE]:~/crafter**

Example:

.. code-block:: sh
    :linenos:

     scp -i ~/user-test-aws.pem ~/Desktop/crafter ubuntu@ec2-34-293-227-96.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/crafter

**Install the private key on the delivery server**

The next step is to log in to the delivery server and install the private key into the crafter user's account.

To do this, SSH on to the delivery server as the ubuntu user and execute the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh
    :linenos:

    sudo cp crafter /home/crafter/.ssh/id_rsa

.. code-block:: sh
    :linenos:

    sudo chown crafter:crafter /home/crafter/.ssh/id_rsa

3.2.4 Log in to the authoring server from the delivery server(s) using SSH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that both our public and private keys are installed on their respective servers we're going to test that they work properly and establish a fingerprint for the authoring server on the delivery server. To do this:

SSH on to the delivery server as the ubuntu user and execute the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    sudo su crafter
    ssh -o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa crafter@ec2-3-93-34-40.compute-1.amazonaws.com

It's important that you include the  **-o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa** parameter in the initial SSH connection to the authoring server. Crafter expects the fingerprint to be stored in an RSA format. Once you execute the SSH command to log in to the authoring machine from the delivery machine as the crafter user. You will be prompted to verify the auhtenticity of the authoring server.  Type yes to confirm.  After this you will be logged in to the authoring server.  No further action is required. Type exit in to the command line of the authoring server to terminate the SSH session.

.. code-block:: text
    :linenos:

    The authenticity of host 'ec2-3-93-34-40.compute-1.amazonaws.com (172.31.79.17)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:OWVEsHafTLRPlmAO/J/RtvXoCrsx2oMKm4qMooIm+WE.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

    Warning: Permanently added 'ec2-3-93-34-40.compute-1.amazonaws.com,172.31.79.17' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-1031-aws x86_64)

    ....

    exit

---------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Intitialize the site on the delivery server
---------------------------------------------------
Now that secure communication is established between the authoring and delivery instances, we can initialize any number of sites to be delivered by the delivery instance. It's verys simple to initialize a site on the delivery instance. To do so:

SSH to the delivery server and execute the following command in the **/opt/crafter/bin** directory as the **crafter** user:

.. code-block:: sh
    :linenos:

    init-site.sh

When the init-site.sh command is executed without any parameters, parameter documentation will be presented. We'll use the following parameters in our example based on our public/private key setup that we did in the previous steps:

.. code-block:: sh
    :linenos:

    init-site.sh -b live [SITE_ID] ssh://crafter@[DNS_NAME_OF_AUTHORING_SERVER]:/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/[SITE_ID]/published

The SITE_ID parameter can be acquired from the authoring server. Log in to Crafter Studio and "Preview" the site you wish to initialize and you will find the SITE_ID in the URL.

.. image:: /_static/images/ami/craftercms-siteid.jpg
    :width: 100 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Crafter CMS AWS AMI Delivery Site Id

Successful execution of this command will produce output similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    Creating Solr Core...
    Core created successfully
    Creating Deployer Target...
    Target created successfully

Example:

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    init-site.sh -b live editorial ssh://crafter@ec2-3-93-34-40.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/editorial/published

.. image:: /_static/images/ami/craftercms-aws-ami-initsite.png
    :width: 100 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Crafter CMS AWS AMI Delivery initsite

You can further verify that the deployment is working by watching the logs.  To watch the logs use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh
    :linenos:

    tail -n 1000 -f /opt/crafter/logs/deployer/crafter-deployer.out

Look for output that is similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    2019-04-17 21:39:00.001 INFO 4389 --- [pool-5-thread-1] o.c.d.impl.processors.GitPullProcessor : Cloning Git remote repository ssh://crafter@ec2-3-93-34-40.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/editorial/published into /opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/editorial
    2019-04-17 21:39:00.806 INFO 4389 --- [pool-5-thread-1] o.c.d.impl.processors.GitPullProcessor : Successfully cloned Git remote repository ssh://crafter@ec2-3-93-34-40.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/editorial/published into /opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/editorial

---------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5: View the site on the delivery server from a web browser
---------------------------------------------------------------
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Now that site has deployed it can be viewied via web browser. As previously mentioned, Crafter's delivery tier is multi-tenant.  A SITE_ID is used on the URL to indicate which tenant is to be displayed. To preview the site you initialized, open a browser and navigate to the following URL:

.. note::
   The **SITE_ID** parameter is typically added automatically to all requests for a given site by a webserver "virtual host" configured for each site/tenant that sits in front of Crafter Engine. You can learn more about this here: :ref:`configure-apache-vhost-for-production`

This configuration and other advanced topology topics such as load balancing are outside the scope of a basic installation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6: Make an update in authoring and see it published on the delivery server
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To further test publishing, log in to Crafter Studio for the given site, make an edit and then approve the edit for publish. In a few moments you will see your updates in the web browser on the delivery server.  You can find step by step instructions on editing and publishing here: :ref:`your_first_website`
