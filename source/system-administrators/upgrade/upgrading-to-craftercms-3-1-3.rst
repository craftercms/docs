===============================================================================
Docker/Kuber Instructions for Upgrading to CrafterCMS 3.1.3 from 3.1.0 version
===============================================================================

To upgrade 3.1.0 Docker/Kuber deployments to 3.1.3:

#. Compare the custom shared/classes volume-mounted config files with the ones from 3.1.3, and make any necessary changes:

   * For authoring_tomcat: https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/tree/v3.1.3/resources/env/authoring/tomcat-config/crafter
   * For delivery_tomcat: https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/tree/v3.1.3/resources/env/delivery/tomcat-config/crafter

   |

#. Change the image version to 3.1.3 and restart containers.
#. Wait for the containers to come up, the ``authoring_tomcat`` log should show some DB errors.

   .. code-block:: sh

      docker-compose exec tomcat gosu crafter /opt/crafter/bin/crafter.sh upgradedb

#. Restart the authoring_tomcat container. The DB errors shouldn't appear anymore.
