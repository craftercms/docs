       * This guide assumes that you're trying to upgrade a site from a stock 3.1.x Studio and with some slight Studio configuration changes. If your site configuration is heavily customized or your Studio is a custom overlay you might need additional work that is not specified here.

       * If you are upgrading to 3.1.x from a previous 3.0.x version, the automatic upgrade scripts are not enabled and you will need to follow :ref:`these instructions<upgrade-to-3-1-0>` to upgrade manually.

       * If you are upgrading from an earlier release (2.5.x), you would need to upgrade to 3.0.x first before performing the upgrade steps here.  See the 3.0 releaseâ€™s Upgrading CrafterCMS page here: https://craftercms.com/docs
