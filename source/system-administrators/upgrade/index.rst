Upgrading CrafterCMS
=====================

This section details the steps required to upgrade your CrafterCMS install.

    .. WARNING::
       * This guide assumes that you're trying to upgrade a site from a stock 3.1.x Studio and with some slight Studio configuration changes. If your site configuration is heavily customized or your Studio is a custom overlay you might need additional work that is not specified here.

       * This guide also assumes that you are upgrading to version 3.1.1 or later. If you are upgrading to 3.1.0, the automatic upgrade scripts are not enabled and you will need to follow :ref:`these instructions<upgrade-to-3-1-0>` to upgrade manually.

       * If you are upgrading to version 3.1.10 or later release, you would need to upgrade to 3.1.9 first before upgrading to a later version.

       * If you are upgrading from an earlier release (2.5.x), you would need to upgrade to 3.0.x first before performing the upgrade steps here.  See the 3.0 releaseâ€™s Upgrading CrafterCMS page here: https://docs.craftercms.org
