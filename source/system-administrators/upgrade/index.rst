=====================

This section details the steps required to upgrade your Crafter CMS install.

.. WARNING::
   * This guide assumes that you're trying to upgrade a site from a stock 3.1.x Studio and with some slight Studio configuration changes. If your site configuration is heavily customized or your Studio is a custom overlay you might need additional work that is not specified here.

   * The following release versions are able to upgrade to 4.0.0

     - 3.1.9
     - 3.1.12
     - 3.1.13
     - 3.1.17
     - 3.1.18

     If you are upgrading from a version other than the ones listed above, you will need to upgrade to the latest 3.1 release first before upgrading to 4.0.0.  See the 3.1 release’s Upgrading Crafter CMS page here: https://docs.craftercms.org
