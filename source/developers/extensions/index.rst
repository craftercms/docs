CrafterCMS extensions extend the CMS and provide the users additional functionality.  It allows developers
to create new experiences both for authors and end-users.

There are two main types of CrafterCMS Extensions:

* **Blueprints**

  Blueprints provide an initial set of styles, pages, behaviors, content types and more.
  It can be used directly from CrafterCMS when creating a new project.

  For more information on blueprints, see :ref:`here <create-a-blueprint>`

* **Plugins**

  Plugins allow users to either replace, extend or even create stand alone experiences to serve a particular
  use case or set of use cases. It allows developers to create extensions to both authoring and delivery and
  can be installed on projects directly from CrafterCMS.

  Delivery plugins can provide features, functionalities and full experiences that can be used in
  the delivery side of CrafterCMS projects (i.e. sites, mobile apps, etc). Examples of these are a
  ready-to-use contact form, a chat bot or integrations with third-party analytics software.

  On the other hand, authoring plugins open the door for developers to customize and extend Crafter
  Studio. Through authoring extensions, Studio UI can be extended by including new widgets into specific
  portions of the UI or by creating complete applications that run in their own
  :ref:`private route within Crafter Studio <plugin-host>`.

  For more information on plugins, see :ref:`here <plugins>`
