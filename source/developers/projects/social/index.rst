Crafter Social is a multi-tenant, platform independent user-generated content management system for handling all actions related to user-generated content (UGC), including the creation, updating and moderation of the content.  It is built on MongoDB and uses :ref:`crafter-profile` for profile, tenant, roles management, and authentication.  Crafter Social is highly scalable in terms of both the users & data, and secures the generated content using Crafter Profile and the Crafter Profile Security library.  As a headless, RESTful application, Crafter Social allows for loosely coupled integration with the vertical applications using it.  Some examples of these vertical applications include:

    - a products site, for example a books site with reviews & ratings,
    - a ratings site and
    - a blogging application with threaded comments.

Configuration
-------------

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Clam Virus Scanner Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Clamav must be installed (along with the clamd deamon)
* A TCPhost and a TCPport must be provided in the clamd.conf file
* The clamd deamon must be running with the provided configuration

Note: With the information given so far a localhost 3310 configuration is necessary and enough to run the clam virus scanner tests

* The crafter-social virus-scanner properties file must match the host and the port configured in the clamd.conf file
* A ClamVirusScannerImpl should be provided to the VirusScannerService bean in a virus-scanner-context.xml external file

Note: There is a nullVirusScannerImpl being given to the VirusScannerService as the default implementation (which means that the virus scanning is disable by default).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
