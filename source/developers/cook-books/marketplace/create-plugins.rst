GitHub App

The Crafter Marketplace provides a very simple way of publishing plugins from a GitHub repository, once your plugin
is ready to be submitted you can follow these steps:

#.  Install the Crafter Marketplace GitHub App in your repository:
    
    #.  Open a browser and go to `<https://github.com/marketplace/crafter-marketplace>`_

          :align: center
          :width: 80%

        |
    
    #.  Click the ``Install it for free`` button

          :width: 40%

        |
    
    #.  Click the ``Complete order and begin installation`` button

          :width: 80%

        |
    
    #.  Select the repositories for your plugins and click the ``Install`` button

          :width: 80%

        |
    
    #.  From your account settings you can:
        
        - Add or remove repositories from the application
        - Uninstall the application from your account

#.  Create a tag in your repository for the version of the plugin that you will submit:
    
    ``git tag v1.0.0``

#.  Push the tag to GitHub:

    ``git push --tags``

#.  The Crafter Marketplace will automatically detect the new tag in your repository and will start processing
    a new version for your plugin (or a new plugin if it doesn't exit yet)

#.  You will receive an email notification to the address configured in your GitHub account.

.. warning:: 
  Make sure to always change the plugin version in the ``craftercms-plugin.yaml`` the next time you create a tag or
  the submit process will fail

  Also remember to set your GitHub repository to public so Crafter can pull from the repository. If you're interested in private plugins/marketplace, you'll need to switch to the Enterprise Edition of CrafterCMS.
