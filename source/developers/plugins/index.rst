CrafterCMS plugins allow developers to create extensions to both authoring and delivery.

Delivery extensions can provide features, functionalities and full experiences that can be used in
the delivery side of CrafterCMS projects (i.e. sites, mobile apps, etc). Examples of these are a
ready-to-use contact form, a chat bot or integrations with third-party analytics software.

On the other hand, authoring extensions open the door for developers to customize and extend Crafter
Studio. Through authoring extensions, Studio UI can be extended by including new widgets into specific
portions of the UI or by creating complete applications that run in their own
:ref:`private route within Crafter Studio <plugin-host-page>`.

For further excitement, developers may submit their plugins to the :ref:`CrafterCMS Marketplace <marketplace>`,
which provides a home for the Crafter community to contribute, find, and use plugins.

There are two main types of CrafterCMS plugins:
