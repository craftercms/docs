What is a Project/Site?
-----------------------

A project or a site is a collection of related pages/components and assets.

For the project repository, the project structure looks like this::

        {REPOSITORY_ROOT}/sites/PROJECTNAME/sandbox/
            config
                engine
                studio
                    administration
                    content-types
                    data-sources
                    dependency
                    workflow

Localization is the process of adapting the application/software to a specific culture of end users, such as units of
measurements, language, etc., to make the application look and feel natural to the end users.

.. _studio-project-time-zone:

Project Time Zone
-----------------

The :ref:`default dates and times <server-time-zone>` used for displays in Studio is UTC. To
customize how dates & times get displayed on Studio UI for a project, edit the following in the project
configuration file, by clicking on |projectTools| from the *Sidebar*, then click on **Configuration**
and finally selecting **Project Configuration** from the list:

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

   <locale>
     <!--
     BCP 47 language tag (e.g. en-US) or unicode extension (e.g. "en-US-u-ca-buddhist").
     Leave empty for using the user's browser locale (i.e. dates/times will be displayed in each users's system locale).
     Specifying a locale code will apply those localization settings to *all* users regardless of their system settings
     or location. For example, if "en-US", is specified, all users will see dates as month/day/year instead of day/month/year
     regardless of their system (i.e. OS) locale preference.
     -->
     <localeCode/>
     <!--
     Use `dateTimeFormatOptions` to customize how dates & times get displayed on Studio UI.
     For full list of options and docs, visit: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat
     -->
     <dateTimeFormatOptions>
     <!--
     Specifying a time zone (i.e. `timeZone` element) will express dates/times across the UI in the time zone you specify
     here. Leaving it unspecified, will display dates/times to each user in their own system time zone.

.. _targeting-guide:

Content Targeting Guide
-----------------------
Crafter Engine provides the ability to render content adapted to specific users, depending on different
aspects like geographical location, language, preferences, etc.
Content that is targeted to users is known in CrafterCMS as targeted content.

.. _language-based-localized-content:

Language-Based Localized Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most common form of targeted content is language-based localization, which is enabled just by specifying
some configuration in the :ref:`Engine's Project Config <engine-project-configuration>`.

The Engine project configuration file can be accessed by clicking on |projectTools| from the *Sidebar*,
then click on **Configuration** and finally selecting **Engine Project Configuration** from the list:

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <site>
      <targeting>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
        <rootFolders>/site/website</rootFolders>
        <fallbackTargetId>en</fallbackTargetId>
        <mergeFolders>true</mergeFolders>
        <redirectToTargetedUrl>true</redirectToTargetedUrl>
      </targeting>
    </site>

By default, Crafter Engine thinks that targeted content is organized in folders, directly underneath
``rootFolders``. So following the configuration posted above:

#. Targeting is enabled through the property ``targeting.enabled``.
#. Each folder underneath /site/website (``targeting.rootFolders``) will hold the content for a different
    locale, like *en*, *es*, *fr*, *jp*, etc.
#. If for example, Engine will render /site/website/index.xml and the locale for the current user is
    *es_CR*, then Engine will try to resolve first to /site/website/es_CR/index.xml, /site/website/es/index.xml,
    and finally, since *en* is the ``targeting.fallbackTargetId``, /site/website/en/index.xml. If there was
    no ``targeting.fallbackTargetId``, then the last candidate page for rendering would be /site/website/index.xml.
#. The ``targeting.mergeFolders`` property will make Engine create merged content trees, which is useful for
    navigation. For example, assume that for the top navigation of a page the first level of pages under
    /site/website/{locale} will be displayed, and the locale for the current user again is *es_CR*. Under *es_CR*
    just the "Contact Us" page exists, but under *en* there are more: "Products", "About Us" and "Contact Us".
    By setting ``mergeFolders`` as true, the final pages that are displayed in the navigation would be
    /site/website/en/products, /site/website/en/about-us and /site/website/es_CR/contact-us.
#. Normally, if a user goes to my-editorial.com/contact-us, and the current locale is *es_CR*, then page to be
    rendered would be resolved to /site/website/es_CR/contact-us, but the browser navigation bar would still show
    my-editorial.com/contact-us. If ``targeting.redirectToTargetedUrl`` is set to true, then instead the user is
    redirected first to my-editoriaal.com/es_CR/contact-us.

It's important to point out that if a page exists several times under the same "family" of locales, like *en*
(fallback), *es* and *es_CR*, and the merge strategy for the page is ``targetedContent``, the content is inherited
following the path of the most general locale to the most specific one, so /site/website/es_CR/contact-us, would
inherit and overwrite the content of /site/website/es/contact-us and /site/website/en/contact-us.

Configuration for Custom Targeted Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As stated before, the most popular case for targeted content is language-based localization, but it isn't the
only one. Sometimes you need to target content according to the user's region, country, age, gender, etc. For
these cases, a little bit more of coding and configuration is needed:

#. Implement the ``org.craftercms.engine.targeting.TargetIdManager`` and put it under your project's
   Classes > groovy folder, with any folders that should be part of the Java package in-between
   (e.g. Classes > groovy > services > targeting > RegionAndCountryTargetIdManager):

   * ``getCurrentTargetId()`` should return the target ID for the current user, and if the current user doesn't
     have a target ID, the default one. E.g. Assume that we're targeting content by region and country. The
     ``getCurrentTargetId()`` should then return the *region_country* ID of the current user
     (*na*, *na_us*, *lan*, *lan_cr*, etc), and if the current user doesn't have associated a region/country,
     the default *na* is returned.
   * ``getFallbackTargetId()`` should return the target ID used as "last resort" when resolving the URL of the page
     to render to the user. Continuing with the *region_country* example, let's say the user requested for the
     /about page, his current target ID is *lan_cr*, and the fallback target ID is *na*. Engine will then look for
     the page in /site/website/lan_cr/about/index.xml, /site/website/lan/about/index.xml and finally
     /site/website/na/about/index.xml. If the fallback target ID was null, then instead of
     /site/website/lan_cr/about/index.xml, Engine would look in /site/website/about/index.xml.
   * ``getAvailableTargetIds()`` returns a list with all the supported target IDs. In case of the *region_country*
     solution, the list would contain all the possible region/country combinations, like
     *na*, *na_us*, *na_ca*, *lan*, *lan_cr*, etc.

#. Add the ``TargetIdManager`` implementation as a Spring bean in your project's application-context.xml (Config > spring >
   application-context.xml) with the name ``crafter.targetIdManager``:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <bean id="crafter.targetIdManager" class="services.targeting.RegionAndCountryTargetIdManager"/>

Targeted Content By File Prefix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, Engine expects targeted content to be organized by folders. The most common case is to have pages
under /site/website to be grouped under locale folders. So pages for *en* would be put under /site/website/en,
pages for *es* under /site/website/es, and so on.

But sometimes it's more useful to have content for different targets to be under the same location. And for those
cases, Engine can resolve targeted content by file prefix, like index_en.xml, index_en_US.xml, index_fr.xml, etc.
To enable this, add the following bean to your project's application-context.xml
(Config > spring > application-context.xml), which will override the targeted content by folder strategy:

.. code-block:: xml

    <bean id="crafter.targetedUrlStrategy"
      class="org.craftercms.engine.targeting.impl.TargetedUrlByFileStrategy"
      parent="crafter.targetedUrlStrategyBase"/>

"""""""""""""""""""
Proxy Configuration
"""""""""""""""""""
CrafterCMS supports a proxy system to proxy GraphQL, Engine, NodeJS or other application delivery systems.
A proxy server, or proxy for short, is an application or system that acts as a middleman between requests
from clients for resources such as a file or web page for example, and the server that provides those resources.
Whenever a request is made by a client, the request gets sent to the proxy that then evaluates the request and
then performs the required transactions. Proxies forwards web requests, act as a firewall and web filter, provide
shared network connections, and cache data to speed up common requests. It helps to simplify/control the
complexity of the request, and can provide additional benefits such as load balancing, privacy or security.

See :ref:`here <using-the-proxy-configuration>` for an example of setting up the proxy for a React application

Multi-environment Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is often required to have different configurations for different environments. For example, you may want to have developers access different integration services, keys, and configuration than QA, UAT or Prod environments.

CrafterCMS supports environment specific configuration that helps with this, read more about it in the article :ref:`multi-environment-support`.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
URL Rewrites and Vanity URLs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

URL rewriting turns hard to remember, long and complicated URLs into easier to remember, user-friendly and search
engine friendly URLs. Simple URL rewrite rules per project can be done through Crafter Engine.

CrafterCMS comes with the Tuckey URLRewrite filter, a Java Web Filter with functionality like Apache's mod_rewrite,
that lets you setup rewrite rules for your project.

To add a URL rewrite rule, in Studio, open the **Sidebar** then click on |projectTools|. Click on **Configuration** then select **Engine URL Rewrite Configuration (XML Style)**.

Here's an example URL rewrite rule for a project created using the Website Editorial blueprint where requests to
/articles/2020/12/top-books-for-young-women will be redirected to /articles/2021/1/men-styles-for-winter

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <urlrewrite>
     <rule>
       <from>/articles/2020/12/top-books-for-young-women</from>
       <to type="redirect">/articles/2021/1/men-styles-for-winter</to>
     </rule>
   </urlrewrite>


After saving the configuration, remember to publish the configuration file just saved (``urlrewrite.xml`` file). To publish the configuration file, from the **Sidebar**, click on **Dashboard**. In the **My Recent Activity** dashlet, check the box next to the ``urlrewrite.xml`` file, and click **Publish** from the context nav to publish.
