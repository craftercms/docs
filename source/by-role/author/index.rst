For the dashboard shown above, here are the dashlets listed:

    * Activity
        * Shows all items recently modified by all users
        * Viewable by all users

    * Pending Approval
        * Shows all items currently in workflow
        * Viewable only to admins and publishers

    * Scheduled for Publish
        * Shows all items approved for a specific scheduled deployment date
        * Viewable only to admins and publishers

    * Recently Published
        * Shows all items that have been previously deployed
        * Viewable only to admins and publishers

    * My Activity
        * Shows all items recently modified by the current user
        * Viewable by all users

   * Unpublished Work
        * Shows all unpublished items modified by the current user
        * Viewable by all users

   * Expiring
        * Shows all items that are expired or about to expire
        * Viewable by all users

    * Icon Guide
        * The Icon guide is simply a legend to help authors and content managers with the iconography on
          the system. While it can be very complex to sum up the state and nature of content in a glance,
          Crafter Studio attempts to achieve a high level visual summary for each object icons. You will
          see these icons throughout the application whenever an object is presented to the user. The icon
          always shows the Current state of the object.
        * Describes the meaning of icons within Crafter Studio
        * Viewable by all users
        * The Icon guide breaks down icons in to their elements. You have two basic elements which can
          be combined to form a specific icon: the item type and the worfkflow indicator.

            **Item Types**

            Item types are high level archetypes of content objects within the system. These types and the
            iconography associated with them provide a basic classification of the type of object at a glance.

            |workflowPage|:	A page is exactly what you would expect, it's a URI addressable object that
            represents a web page or resource.

            |workflowComponent|: A component is an object that is generally not URI addressable on the project.
            Examples are objects like Banners, Touts, Sidebar content etc. Components are usually re-usable
            assets that can be assigned and shared across many pages.

            |workflowTaxonomy|: A taxonomy is an object the same as a component used for classifying items.

            Below is a list of all the other item types available:

             - |workflowCss|
             - |workflowFolder|
             - |workflowLevelDescriptor|
             - |workflowTemplateScript|
             - |workflowGroovy|
             - |workflowImage|
             - |workflowJavaScript|
             - |workflowJson|
             - |workflowHTML|
             - |workflowCss|
             - |workflowPlainText|
             - |workflowXML|
             - |workflowFont|
             - |workflowIcon|

            |
            |

            **Workflow States**

            Workflow States help authors and content managers understand at a glance what is going on with the
            content at a high level. Is it Live?  Is it work in progress?  Is it currently checked out?
            In some sort of approval process?

            |workflowNeverPub|:	The content has never been pushed live. This helps authors quickly identify which objects that are in progress are already live and which ones are entirely new.

            |workflowEdited|: Edited means that the item has been edited since it was made live. Items move to edited as soon as they are created or when they are edited.

            |workflowDeleted|: Items which carry the red trash can icon but are not editable and previewable are deleted. You will only see these items in dashboards which show historical data

            |workflowLocked|: A locked item is currently in the process of being edited by another author.

            |workflowProcessing|: Item is currently being handled by the system

            |workflowSubmittedForLive|: |br|
            |workflowSubmittedForStaging|: Any item which carries the airplane icon is in some sort of workflow

            |workflowScheduledForLive|: |br|
            |workflowScheduledForStaging|: Item has a launch schedule associated with it

            |workflowPublishing|: Item is currently being published

            |workflowDisabled|:	You will find that some objects have a red circle with a slash in the middle, this means that the object is not deleted but it should not be displayed on the project. It's essentially a logical delete. Imagine a scenario where you need to take an object down immediately because of an inaccuracy while you make corrections. Disable is perfect for this and several other scenarios.

            **Publishing Status/Target**

            |publishStaging|: Item has been published to the ``staging`` publishing target

            |publishLive|: Item has been published to the ``live`` publishing target

    |
    |

    **Selecting a dashboard item**

    Items in some dashlets have the ability to be selected.  Selecting an item allows
    the user to interact with the selected items via the context navigation

    Items in the dashboard have icons which shows the type and current workflow status of the item

^^^^^^^
Preview
^^^^^^^
Every project has a preview. This allows users to see, edit and test the project in a safe authoring sandbox
prior to publishing changes.

    * Preview is a fully functional project but in a safe-to-edit environment
    * The top center shows workflow status and options (three dots) for the current page
    * Author can change the type of preview from one channel to another
    * Author can turn on in-context and drag and drop editing features
    * Author can change the targeting attributes used to view the project
    * Author can view the publish status of the project

Common Navigation Elements
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

~~~~~~~
Toolbar
~~~~~~~
The Toolbar is a fixed element at the top of the page and cannot be scrolled off the page. The toolbar
provides contextual workflow and other options relative to the page you are looking at, content you have
selected or tool you are using.

The basic elements of the Contextual Navigation bar are:

    * Branded Logo Button: Toggles the sidebar on/off.
    * Project Name and Project switcher: Displays the project's name and lets you switch the project being
      previewed through a dropdown
    * Quick Create: A shortcut for content authors to create configured content without having to navigate
      through the project tree.
    * Preview Address Bar: An area reserved for navigation buttons (back, forward and reload page), the address
      of the current page being previewed, and an options link whose content will change based off of the
      current page view and user role. This can also help authors search for content in the project and preview it quickly.
    * Edit Mode Switch: Toggles the in-context editing and Experience Builder panel on/off
    * Publish Status: Allows the user to view the project's publish status.
    * Search: Allows the user to search for items in the project
    * Navigation Menu: Takes the user to a panel with ``Global`` and ``Project`` options containing various
      links such as Dashboard, About, Help, etc.

Author Experience Builder (XB)
------------------------------
CrafterCMS's Experience Builder (XB) enables authors with in-context editing (ICE) for all the model
fields defined in the content types of pages and components.

In this section, we describe how authors can use the Experience Builder for adding/editing content. But first, let's explore the screens of the Experience Builder.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Experience Builder Screens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When in-context editing is turned on (``Edit mode`` pencil is green or ``Move mode`` two vertical ellipsis
is blue at the top), it puts the page in construction mode. When you hover your mouse around regions of
the page that have been wired for in-context editing, a pencil will show up instead of the mouse cursor.

.. image:: /_static/images/content-author/preview-page-in-context-editing.webp
    :width: 65 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Navigating Studio - Preview Page In-Context Editing

|

This pencil allows you to edit the content of the wired region, including the current page's template and
controller depending on your user account permissions

.. image:: /_static/images/content-author/preview-in-context-edit.webp
    :width: 65 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Navigating Studio - Preview In-Context Editing

|

To turn off in-context editing, click on the ``Switch off editing`` off switch icon at the top, which will
then turn the ``Edit mode``/``Move mode`` icon to gray.

Convenient keyboard shortcuts are also provided, press ``?`` to see the list of commands.

^^^^^^
Search
^^^^^^
The Search tool allows you to search for components and static assets in the project then display the
results from which the user can drag and drop into the current page being viewed if there are configured
drop targets in it

.. image:: /_static/images/content-author/preview-experience-builder-search.webp
    :width: 20 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Navigating Studio - Experience Builder Panel Search Components and Static Assets

|

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Add Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``Add Components`` tool allows you to create new components by dragging components from the panel and
on to the screen to configured drop targets. A new component with default values will then be visible and
ready for editing when a new component is dropped on the screen.

To turn on Experience Builder, simply click on the pencil (Edit mode), which will turn green when enabled,
or the two sets of three vertical dots (Move Mode), which will turn blue when enabled, at the top right of
Studio. Enabling ``Edit mode`` or ``Move mode``  turns on the ``Experience builder`` panel on the right
side of the screen.

``Edit Mode`` allows editing the content directly in its preview for configured sections of the project.
It also provides short-cut menus to open specific pieces of the content form, and the experience builder
panel on the right side of Studio.

To edit content directly in its preview, simply hover your mouse on sections that have been wired for
editing content directly and a pencil will show up instead of the mouse cursor. For editing text sections,
double click on the section and a cursor should then appear allowing you to edit it directly. Notice too
that the editable section will be inside a blue box like below:

panel on the right side of Studio, just like the ``Edit Mode``.

To move items around, move your mouse over to the item/section you want to move until a blue box
appears around it. Click and hold your mouse then drag the item to desired position. A red line
will appear on possible positions to drag your item to, and a trash bin in case you want to remove
your item.

Using the Experience Builder Panel
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Let's take  a look at an example of editing a post using the experience builder (XB) panel in a project
created using the ``Wordify`` blueprint from the Marketplace.

We'll change the picture in the ``Bio`` section of one of the posts. Let's preview the post
``How to Find the Video Games of Your Youth``. Turn on the XB panel by clicking on the pencil icon
(Edit mode) at the top right. The pencil should turn green and the XB panel visible on the right
hand side.

We'll highlight the ``Author Bio`` area in post to figure out which image we want to change. In the
XB panel, click on ``Component Drop Targets``. Select ``Bio`` from the dropdown. Notice you'll see
``Author Bio`` listed as one of the drop targets. Scroll down the page and you should find an area
highlighted in a green box. This is the area where we want to change the image

.. image:: /_static/images/content-author/xb-drop-target-bio.webp
    :alt: Getting Started - Using XB to display drop target area
    :width: 85 %
    :align: center

Let's now change the image for author ``John Doe``. In the XB panel, click on ``Search``. We can
scroll through the items listed there to look for a new image for ``John Doe``, or, we can also type
``image`` in the search box to narrow down items we're scrolling through to just images in the project.
We'll pick the image ``person_2.jpg`` to replace the current ``Profile Pic`` in the ``Bio`` section.
To replace the image, simply drag ``person_2.jpg`` image from the XB panel to the profile pic on the
page. The ``Bio`` section should now have a new image.

.. image:: /_static/images/content-author/xb-new-pic-bio.webp
    :alt: Getting Started - Bio picture changed via XB
    :width: 85 %
    :align: center

Another way to browse for images to replace the Bio picture is by browsing items under ``Assets`` in
the XB panel. Scroll through the items, then when you find a suitable image, simply drag it on to the
page to the image section you want to replace. Notice that as you're dragging an image from the XB panel,
some other sections may be highlighted in a green box. This indicates that an image may be dropped
into that area.

------------------
Working with Pages
------------------
This section describes how content authors can create and use pages to manage content.
Templates are used for page layouts in CrafterCMS. A developer usually creates the templates
that authors can then use to manage content.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Adding a Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are a couple of ways to add a page in your project.

"""""""""""""""
Via the Sidebar
"""""""""""""""
To add a page, open the Sidebar panel, then click on **Pages**. Navigate to the level and location
within the path navigation tree where you want to create the content, then click on the three dots
next to the parent item and select *New Content*

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-add-new-content.webp
   :width: 40 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Add New Page Content

|

You will then be prompted to choose a content type. Select a starter page template from the list
shown. If you need a template that's not available or want to modify the template, ask a developer
to add/modify the template that you want.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-add-choose-content.webp
   :width: 75 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Add New Page Choose Content

|

A form will open containing the template selected. You can now start adding content. Required fields
have a red 'x' after the field label. The number of required fields within each section is displayed
in the Section bar for that section.

When data is entered into a field, the red 'x' will change to a green checkmark and the section bar
will update with the new status.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-add-template-open.webp
   :width: 75 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Add New Page Open Template

An action bar is available at the bottom of the screen that cannot be scrolled away. This bar allows
users to Save as Draft, Save & Minimize, Save & Preview, Save & Close or Cancel.

    * **Save as Draft** will save the content entered on the form and leave the New Page/Editing dialog open
    * **Save & Minimize** will save the content entered on the form, then minimize the form
    * **Save & Preview** will save the content entered on the form then close the form and load the
      preview screen with the newly saved data
    * **Save & Close** will save the content then close the form.
    * **Cancel** will close the form without making any changes and will warn users if there are
      unsaved changes.

To minimize the form, click on the ``-`` at the top of the Content Form right next to the ``x``.
When a form is minimized, it will appear at the bottom right of the screen with an arrow pointing
up next to it. To maximize the form, simply click on that arrow pointing up.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-add-minimized.webp
   :width: 75%
   :align: center
   :alt: Page - Action Bar Minimize/Maximize Icon

An error form will appear when you try to *Save and Close* without filling out all the required fields.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-save-error.webp
   :width: 50 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Page Save Error

""""""""""""""""
Via Quick Create
""""""""""""""""
Here we'll take a look at how to add a page via quick create.  Quick create allows you to create content with as few clicks as possible.
We'll use a project created using the ``Website Editorial`` blueprint, which has the ``Article`` content type (a page content type) :ref:`configured for quick create <setting-up-quick-create>`.

To add a new page, simply click on the **Quick Create** icon (``+``) on the top left of the screen.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/quick-create-btn-expanded.webp
   :width: 40 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Add new Page content via quick create

This will create a new page under ``/articles/{year}/{month}`` and open a form for the author to fill in content.  The form that opens is the same as the form described in the previous section.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Form based editing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Forms are one of the means by which content is captured in Crafter Studio. A form generally maps
to or represents a type of object in the system for example a certain kind of page - like
a section page or a banner or video.

Form controls are the building blocks of forms. It lets you get content into the system.
These form controls are able to capture content either when editing via a form dialog or
through the experience builder (XB) in Preview mode.

Let's look at some common elements of a form and examine
some of the controls that we use to get content in to the system.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-form.webp
   :width: 55 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Page Form

|

When a new page is created or a page is edited, the form interface for these functions will
open in a new dialog. A user can Expand or Collapse all of the sections on the page using the
"Expand All" or "Collapse All" links at the top of the page.
Clicking the +/- control on the Section Label will toggle the expanded or collapsed state for each section.

The number of required fields within each section is displayed in the Section bar for that section.

An icon in front of the Section Label will display a red 'x' (when required fields are not complete),
or a green check mark (when all required fields are complete) to denote status.

Every required field will have a red 'x' icon after it's Field Label.

When data is entered into a field the red 'x' will change to a green check mark and the section bar
will update with the new status. An action bar is available at the bottom of the screen that cannot
be scrolled away. This bar allows users to Save, Save & Minimize, Save & Preview, Save & Close or
Cancel and minimize/maximize the form.

* **Save as Draft** will save the content entered on the form and leave the New Page/Editing dialog open
* **Save & Minimize** will save the content entered on the form, then minimize the form
* **Save & Preview** will save the content entered on the form then close the form and load the
  preview screen with the newly saved data
* **Save & Close** will save the content then close the form.
* **Cancel** will close the form without making any changes and will warn users if there are unsaved changes.
* To minimize the form, click on the **-** at the top of the Content Form right next to the **x**.

The fields within each section are completely modular and can be applied to any given page as needed.
This modularity allows us to craft edit pages for any new screens as they arise without the need for
specific UI work on the edit screen.

""""""""""""""""
Editing Controls
""""""""""""""""

Here are some controls that authors may encounter while editing content:

* Dropdowns - Allows the user to select an item from the list. When not selecting an item from the
  dropdown, the selected item is shown on the box.

* Group checkboxes - Allows users to select one or more items in a group
* Input boxes - Simple text input control allows users to input text up to the character limit
  indicated next to the input box. The character limit specifies both the MAXLENGTH and SIZE
  attributes for the field. The character counter will count up as the user types into the field.
* Date/Time pickers - The Date and Time input can allow entry of both Date and Time, only Date or
  only Time, depending on what was setup.
* Rich text editors - What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor that allows authors to arrange
  and style content without needing to know HTML. Below is a more detailed description on working in the RTE.
* Repeating Group - Group of controls (1 or more controls) that can be duplicated multiple times by
  clicking on **Add Another**. If there are two or more instances, "Move Up" and "Move Down" links
  will be available which will move the group up or down in relation to the other group instances.

""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Placing Content Components
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Drag and drop makes it easy for authors to visually assemble pages. Authors simply choose a
component from a pre-defined list of components/widgets, drag them on to the screen, place
them where they want (in defined drop zones), and then configure them. Authors may also move
components from one zone to another or remove components.

The ``Edit Mode`` switch puts the page in component construction mode. Regions on the page
that are wired to accept components ("drop target") are highlighted. In the component construction
mode, the user may drag an existing component or place a new component to be configured in the drop
target. The user may also drag a component from one region to another. Crafter Studio administrators
can configure what components are available in this panel.

* Placing new components

  The user may create new components by dragging components from the experience builder panel
  (**Component** section) out and on to the drop target on the screen. A new component with
  default values will then be visible and ready for editing when a new component is dropped on the screen.

Working in the Rich Text Editor(RTE)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The RTE (Rich Text Editor) is intended to provide an in-context editing experience from within a form
(and through preview via the XB) that allows authors to arrange and style content without needing to know HTML.
In an RTE field, the RTE toolbar is at the top, and is always available regardless of how far down you
scroll in the RTE field.

There are a number of tools available from the RTE out of the box for editing your content. Custom
tools may also be added to the RTE, depending on your needs. Please see the developer section
:ref:`rte-configuration` of the docs for more details.

Copying a Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To copy a page, in the Sidebar panel, click on the **Pages** folder. Navigate to the level and location
within the project navigation tree where you want to copy content, then click on the three dots next to
the page and select **Copy**

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-copy-menu.webp

In the Sidebar panel, navigate to the level and location within the project navigation tree where you
want to paste the copied content, then click on the three dots next to it and select **Paste**

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-paste-menu.webp
   :width: 30 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Paste Page Menu

|

Depending on how the page content type has been modeled (dependencies), copying and pasting a page
may also create copies of items in the page. These dependencies are setup by the developers when
creating the content type. Generally, when an item on a page is uploaded to the following locations:
``/site/components/item/.*`` or  ``/static-assets/item/.*``, when the page containing those items is
copied, a copy of the uploaded items are created.

To learn more about these dependencies and see examples, see :ref:`item-specific-dependencies` or
:ref:`copy-dependencies-configuration`.

.. _disabling-a-page:

""""""""""""""""
Disabling a Page
""""""""""""""""

A page content type can be modeled to disable a page in content delivery via the reserved variable ``disabled``.
This variable indicates an object is “hidden” in live and cannot be retrieved via services like search or the
site item service.

To model a content type that allows disabling a page, do the following:

#. Open the content type you'd like to add ``disabled`` by opening the Sidebar, then clicking on
   ``Project Tools`` -> ``Content Type``, then select the desired page content type
#. Drag a ``Check Box`` control to the ``Page Property`` form section. Set the ``Title`` to something
   descriptive, say ``Disable Page`` and remember that the ``Name/Variable Name`` value needs to be
   set to ``disabled``. Save your changes.

Let's take a look at an example of a page content type with ``disabled`` and how the page appears in preview and
in delivery. We will be using a project created using the ``Website Editorial`` blueprint named
``my-editorial`` for this example.

We'll open the content type ``Article`` of the project. Below is the ``Article`` content type modeled
with ``disabled``, as described above.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-disable-setup.webp
   :width: 75 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Content Type with disabled setup

|

Let's now disable an article in the project, then publish it and see how the project behaves in delivery when
a page has been disabled.

We'll disable the article ``10 Tips to Get a Six Pack``. First, we'll take a look at how the ``Health``
category page looks like with the article still enabled in Preview by opening the Sidebar, then clicking
on the ``Home`` page then finally click on the ``Health`` category on the left-rail.:

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-enabled.webp
   :width: 60 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Article "10 Tips to Get a Six Pack" enabled

|

Notice above that there are three articles listed in the ``Health`` category page and it contains the
article that we are now going to disable. To disable the page ``10 Tips to Get a Six Pack``, open the
Sidebar, then navigate to ``/articles/2021/2/``. Click on the three dots next to the article then select
``Edit``, which will open a form allowing us to edit the article. Once the form opens, put a checkmark
on the ``Disable Page`` field under the ``Page Properties`` section then save your changes.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-disable-article.webp
   :width: 60 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Disable article "10 Tips to Get a Six Pack"

|

Preview the ``Home`` page and click on the ``Health`` category on the left-rail. Notice that the article we
disabled is not listed in the preview. Note too that on the Sidebar, the article we disabled will have
a red circle with a slash on it indicating that the page is disabled.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-disabled.webp
   :width: 60 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Article "10 Tips to Get a Six Pack" disabled

|

Finally, we'll publish the changes we made to the article and verify that in delivery, the article we
disabled is not available/accessible. To publish your changes, on the Sidebar, click on the three dots
next to the article we just edited, then select ``Publish``. A Publish dialog will appear. Check the
information in the dialog and make changes as required, then click on the ``Publish`` button.

In your browser, go to ``localhost:9080?crafterSite=my-editorial`` to view your project in delivery. Next,
we'll view the ``Health`` category page and verify that the article ``10 Tips to Get a Six Pack`` is not listed:

**Filtering Results**:  Crafter Studio supports multiple ways to filter search results. Depending on your search results, different filters will be available. Generally, you can sort your search results based on the following:

* Sort By
  * Relevance
  * Name
  * Width
  * Content Type
  * MIME Type
  * Content Size
  * Last Edit  Date
  * Height

* Path
* Width
* Content Type

Workflows
---------

This section describes the simple default workflow available from CrafterCMS.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Workflow and Scheduled Deployments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Workflow is the act of moving content through its lifecycle. A simple workflow option that includes
submission, review/reject and approve and publish immediate / publish on a schedule options are
provided by default. Workflow options are available to specific content, such as pages or static assets,
etc. The available workflow options for users depends on the Role the users are assigned with. As the
content goes through the workflow options, notification emails are sent out to corresponding users based
on the workflow option. To setup the email addresses, please see the section **Site Administrators**,
:ref:`configure-notifications` and  :ref:`users-group-management`. Below is a diagram showing
the default workflow steps.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-workflow-diagram.webp
    :width: 75 %

    :alt: Workflow - Diagram

|

We will be looking at the workflow steps in this section. Workflow is managed through dialogs. Below
is a sample dialog:

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Submitting Content for Approval
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

After creating/editing content, a request to publish content can be done by clicking on **Publish**.
A **Publish** submission can be initiated from a preview screen through the toolbar by clicking on
the three dots next to the address bar or by clicking on the three dots next to the article in the
Sidebar (for single items), or from the Dashboard (where items can be batch checked).

Initiate a Publish through the toolbar at the top:

    :width: 35 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Workflow - Request publish by right clicking on content in nav tree

|

When sending the request for publish, you have the option of requesting to publish your content now,
or to schedule publishing of your content at a later time and date.

     :width: 65 %
     :align: center
     :alt: Workflow - Request publish later dialog

|

Users with permission to publish can also make changes and request approval for publishing their changes
by checking the ``Request approval`` checkbox in the Publish dialog

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-workflows-request-publish.webp
     :width: 65 %
     :align: center
     :alt: Workflow - Request publish approval dialog

|

To make approval mandatory for publish requests for users with publish permission,
see :ref:`here <project-config-require-peer-review>`.

After clicking on the **Submit** or **Schedule** button (depending on the option selected for publishing
now or later), a notification email will be sent to the project's approvers. Notice also, that the
toolbar now displays the icon for **Submitted**

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-workflows-submitted-context-nav.webp
     :width: 75 %
     :align: center
     :alt: Workflow - Request publish submitted context nav updated icon and text

|

You'll also notice the **Submitted** icon is displayed next to the content item in the Sidebar for the
content you just submitted a request for publish and contains the text **Submitted for live**

""""""""""""""""""
Publishing Content
""""""""""""""""""

After a request for publish has been sent, the next step in the workflow is for an approver (a user with
publishing rights) to approve or reject the request for publishing. Notification emails are sent out when
an item has been approved for publish or rejected.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Approve & Publish Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To approve content for publishing, there are a few ways to access the **Publish** workflow option for
approving a publish request.  One way is by going to the dashboard, then in the
**Pending Approval** dashlet, look for the article you want to approve, then put a check
mark next to it.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-workflows-dashboard-approve.webp
     :width: 75 %
     :align: center
     :alt: Workflow - Approve & publish dashboard option

|

Another way to access the **Publish** option is by going to the Sidebar, then navigate to the article you
want to approve, then click on **Options** (the three dots next to it).

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-workflows-nav-tree-approve.webp
     :width: 40 %
     :align: center
     :alt: Workflow - Approve & publish Sidebar nav tree option

|

Yet another way to access the **Publish** option is by going to the Sidebar and then navigating to the
article and opening it for preview. After opening the article for preview, go to the toolbar and click
on **Options** (three dots) next to the address bar.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-workflows-context-nav-approve.webp
     :width: 75 %
     :align: center
     :alt: Workflow - Approve & publish context nav option

|

You can also preview the article that you want to approve by clicking on the link provided in the email
sent to the approver, which should give you the **Publish** option too in the toolbar **Options**.
Below is a sample notification email sent to the approver when user *author* sent a request to publish
content. To modify/setup your notification emails, please contact your site administrator. To see more
details on how to configure your notification emails, see the section for Site Administrators in
:ref:`configure-notifications`

     :width: 40 %
     :align: center
     :alt: Workflow - Notification email to approve/reject request to approver

|

Below is the dialog that loads after clicking on **Publish**. The item scheduling selected in the dialog
depends on what the requester has chosen when the request to publish was sent. In the image below. the
selected scheduling for the item is for the **Now**. Click on **Publish** to publish the content now.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-workflows-approve-publish-now.webp
     :width: 75 %
     :align: center
     :alt: Workflow - Approve publish now

|

In the image below, the requester sent the request to publish with a schedule. Click on the **Schedule**
button to schedule the publishing of the item. The dialog with the date and time when selecting the **Later**
radio button allows the approver to schedule or reschedule the submitted item.

     :width: 75 %
     :align: center
     :alt: Workflow - Approve publish later

|

Once an item has been scheduled to be published, notice the workflow icon next to the article in the
**Sidebar** nav tree, the dashboard and in the context nav when you preview the scheduled for publish item.

The dashboard allows batches of scheduled and non-scheduled items to be pushed live at the same time.
Clicking on **Publish** will change the schedule of all items to be pushed live at the same time.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reject Publish Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To reject a request for publish, open the item for preview, then in the toolbar ``Options``, select **Reject**.
Another way to access the **Reject** option is by opening the dashboard and placing a check mark next to the
item to be rejected, **Reject** should now be available in the context nav.

Approvers may type their own rejection comments or pick canned rejection reasons from the drop-down menu.
Once selected, the editable text area field will be filled with the corresponding rejection notice / ready
for comments in the ``Rejection Comment`` box.

.. _content_authors_targeting:

------------------
Audience Targeting
------------------

This section describes how authors can use audience targeting in creating/previewing experiences.

Targeting allows an author to see what the project would look like if it were being browsed by a
user with a given set of attributes. It also allows an author to tag the content being authored to
the configured attributes on the project.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Tagging Pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When creating a page in a project created using the Website Editorial blueprint, content can be targeted
to the page visitor's segment. This is done by tagging which segment the page is targeted for.

To tag a page, in the Sidebar panel, click on the **Pages** folder. Navigate to the level and location
within the project navigation tree where you want to tag the content, then right click and select **Edit**.
Depending on how tagging was named/setup, go to the section for tagging content and check the box next to
the attribute the page is targeted for.

In the example below, targeting is in the **Metadata** section, under **Segments**, where the available
segments are Anonymous, Guy and Gal, and the page is currently tagged for the segment **Guy**.

Viewing the project with different segments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The authoring environment can be configured with any number of predefined attributes for targeting. A set
of attributes is like a profile, in fact it behaves exactly the same way but instead of setting up and
signing in as specific users to test different scenarios authors can simply switch back and forth between
the available configured attributes.

To find out the current active targeting attributes, switch ``Edit Mode`` to on (pencil icon found on the
top right of Studio, which then opens the experience builder panel on the right hand side). Click on
``Audience Targeting`` and the current attribute values will be displayed in the panel. You can have as
many attributes as you need for your project. To add other attributes, please see the section
:ref:`targeting` in the developer's section of the documentation.

In the Website Editorial blueprint that we are using, the targeting attribute used is ``Segment``.

To view what the project would look like if it were being browsed by a certain segment, open
``Audience Targeting`` by switching on ``Edit Mode`` on the upper right hand of Studio, click on
``Audience Targeting`` then select the segment you would like to see the project with.

Selecting a different segment than the currently selected one, will cause the preview for all
channels to immediately respond with content for a user with the attributes selected. Below,
the segment **Guy** is selected. Notice the articles available on the page has changed to display
only articles targeted to segment **Guy**

Here, the segment **Gal** is selected. Again, notice the articles available on the page.
