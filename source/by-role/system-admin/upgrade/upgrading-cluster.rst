Upgrading Studio Cluster |enterpriseOnly|
=========================================

This section details how to upgrade your Studio cluster.
Please read through the upgrade instructions :ref:`here <upgrading-craftercms-on-a-server>` first as
some of the steps are the same for upgrading your cluster.
To upgrade the cluster, a node will be upgraded and brought up as the primary, then the other node/s will be added.

------------
Upgrade Node
------------
The first step in upgrading your Studio cluster is to upgrade a node and startup your cluster with just the one
upgraded node.  Here are the steps for  upgrading a node:

#. Stop the Studio cluster
#. Do a backup of the primary and replica nodes using the ``crafter.sh`` script by running the following:

   .. code-block:: bash
       :caption: *Backup Studio by running the crafter.sh script*

       ./bin/crafter.sh backup

#. Download the CrafterCMS version you'd like to upgrade to, and extract the files on one of the nodes
#. If you are upgrading from Studio version 3.1.x, run the ``upgrade-search.sh`` script from the new bundle,
   otherwise skip this step

   .. code-block:: bash
       :caption: *Run the upgrade-search script*

       ./upgrade-search.sh /path/of/install/to/be/upgraded --stay-alive

#. Run the ``upgrade-target.sh`` script from the new bundle

   .. code-block:: bash
       :caption: *Run the upgrade-target script*

       ./upgrade-target.sh /path/of/install/to/be/upgraded

#. Review the following configuration files to start Studio in cluster mode as described
   :ref:`here <setup-a-two-node-cluster-with-studio>`:

   - ``bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml``
   - ``bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/hazelcast-config.yaml``
   - ``bin/crafter-setenv.sh`` |br|
     Remember to change the ``MARIADB_CLUSTER_NODE_COUNT`` to ``1`` so that our cluster comes up with just one node

     .. code-block:: bash
         :caption: *Set MARIADB_CLUSTER_NODE_COUNT to 1 in bin/crafter-setenv.sh*

         export MARIADB_CLUSTER_NODE_COUNT=${MARIADB_CLUSTER_NODE_COUNT:="1"}

#. The next step is to run the ``post-upgrade`` script from our target install ``/path/of/install/to/be/upgraded/bin/upgrade``

   .. note:: If you are not upgrading from a Studio version 4.1.x install, remember to switch to Java 17 before
             running the ``post-upgrade.sh`` script.

   The ``post-upgrade.sh`` script will give you a prompt to continue.  Before typing in ``Y``, make sure that Studio
   has started successfully by monitoring the tomcat logs.

   .. code-block:: bash
       :caption: *Post-upgrade script beginning output*
       :emphasize-lines: 4-5

       ./post-upgrade.sh
       ...

       Please make sure Crafter has started successfully before continuing
       > Continue? [(Y)es/(N)o]:

   Please note that Studio may take a while to start up because of upgrade manager updates performed when starting up Studio.
   Your tomcat log should look similar to below when Studio has started successfully:

   .. code-block:: bash
       :caption: *Tomcat log of Studio successfully started*

       ========================================================================
       Crafter has already been started, you can use the system again


#. Monitor the tomcat logs until the upgrade is finished.  Check in Studio that your node is up:

  Once the upgrade is finished shutdown Studio.

.. _adding-a-new-node-to-cluster:

-------------------------
Add a New Node to Cluster
-------------------------
After upgrading a node, we can now add the rest of the node/s to the cluster.
Here are the steps for adding a new node to the cluster:

#. Stop the Studio cluster (the primary server)
#. Make a copy of the ``data/db`` folder from the Primary server.

   .. code-block:: bash
       :caption: *Make a copy of the data/db folder in Primary server*

       cd crafter/data
       tar -czvf dbBackup.tar.gz db/

#. On the server that will be a new Replica, extract the new bundle, then paste the data/db from previous step.

   .. code-block:: bash
      :caption: *In the Replica server, paste the data/db folder copied from the Primary server*

      cd crafter/data
      tar -xvf dbData.tar.gz

#. In the Replica server, review the following configuration files to start Studio in cluster mode as described
   :ref:`here <setup-a-two-node-cluster-with-studio>`:

   - ``bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml``
   - ``bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/hazelcast-config.yaml``
   - ``bin/crafter-setenv.sh`` |br|
     Remember to set the ``MARIADB_CLUSTER_NODE_COUNT`` to ``2``

     .. code-block:: bash
         :caption: *Set MARIADB_CLUSTER_NODE_COUNT to 2*

         export MARIADB_CLUSTER_NODE_COUNT=${MARIADB_CLUSTER_NODE_COUNT:="2"}

#. Start the Primary first and wait until startup has completed by monitoring the tomcat logs
   and looking for something like below:

   .. code-block:: bash
       :caption: *Primary Tomcat startup logs*
       :emphasize-lines: 3
