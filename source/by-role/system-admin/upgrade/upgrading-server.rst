Upgrading CrafterCMS on a Server
================================
This section details how to upgrade CrafterCMS installed on a server.

CrafterCMS provides a couple of scripts for upgrading your installation.

* :ref:`Running the upgrade script (upgrade-target) from a new binary archive <upgrade-using-new-binary-archive>`
* :ref:`Running the upgrade script (start-upgrade) from your current installation <upgrade-using-current-install>`

The upgrade script allows you to do an upgrade, where your bin directory is upgraded, keeping only Tomcat's shared folder, Tomcat's conf folder, the search config, the Deployer config folder, and the crafter-setenv scripts.

When performing an upgrade, CrafterCMS is shut down, then the script asks if the user wants to backup the ``data`` folder. It will then ask if the user wants to backup the ``bin`` folder, then perform the upgrade. After  running  the upgrade script (either *upgrade-target*  or *start-upgrade*), run the ``post-upgrade`` script. Finally, you can :ref:`start your CrafterCMS  <start-crafter-after-upgrade>` install again.

Depending on how recent the version you are upgrading from, there may be files that do not exist in the new release and the script will give the user the option to delete or keep the files.

   .. code-block:: bash
      :force:
      :caption: *Example option to delete or keep files when running upgrade-target script*

      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Config file [apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/search/extension/server-config.properties] doesn't exist in the new release. Delete the file?
      - (N)o
      - (Y)es
      - (A)lways delete files absent from new release and don't ask again
      - (Q)uit the upgrade script (this will stop the upgrade at this point)
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      > Enter your choice:

   |

For config files that are different in the new release, the script gives you the option to overwrite the config files with their new versions. When the script overwrites a file, it creates a backup version of the file with a timestamp and a bak file extension.

   .. code-block:: bash
      :force:
      :caption: *Example option to overwrite config files when running upgrade-target script*

      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Config file [crafter-setenv.sh] is different in the new release. Please choose:
       - (D)iff file versions to see what changed
       - (E)dit the original file (with $EDITOR)
       - (K)eep the original file
       - (O)verwrite the file with the new version
       - (A)lways overwrite config files and don't ask again
       - (Q)uit the upgrade script (this will stop the upgrade at this point)
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   .. note::
      When upgrading to CrafterCMS version 4 from a 3.1.x version, remember to increase the timeout set in the environment variable ``MARIADB_SOCKET_TIMEOUT`` in the ``{Crafter-CMS-install-directory}/bin/crafter-setenv.sh`` file of the CrafterCMS install you're running the upgrade script from to a high enough value to avoid running into a :ref:`db-upgrades-timeout`

----------------
Before Upgrading
----------------
Before starting your upgrade:

#. **Review the** :ref:`release notes <release-notes>` **for the version you are upgrading to**. It contains specific information on the changes that have been made and how it may affect you when upgrading to that specific version.

#. **Backup CrafterCMS** just in case something goes wrong with the upgrade.

   When upgrading CrafterCMS installed on a server, the upgrade scripts performs an automated backup of CrafterCMS, but it's recommended not to rely on the automated backup, just in case. See :ref:`backup-and-restore` for details on how to perform the backup of CrafterCMS

#. **Manually shut down CrafterCMS**   For CrafterCMS installed on a server, the upgrade scripts shuts down CrafterCMS as one of the first steps, but it's also recommended not to rely on the automated shutting down just in case.

   To shutdown CrafterCMS, run the ``shutdown.sh`` script from the ``{Crafter-CMS-install-directory}/bin`` directory


.. _upgrade-using-new-binary-archive:

---------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade by running the upgrade script from a new binary archive
---------------------------------------------------------------
Download the CrafterCMS version you'd like to upgrade to, and extract the files.

To upgrade your CrafterCMS, we will use the ``upgrade-target`` script. The upgrade script  is located in ``{Crafter-CMS-install-directory}/bin/upgrade`` of your newly downloaded binary archive. Here's the description for the script we are going to use:

    .. code-block:: bash

        usage: upgrade-target [options] <target-installation-path>
        -h,--help   Show usage information

|

where:
    ``<target-installation-path>`` is the path of your CrafterCMS install to be upgraded

    ``[options]`` is optional

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Steps for upgrading using the upgrade script from a new binary archive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here are the steps for upgrading your CrafterCMS install version from a new binary archive:

#. Download the CrafterCMS binary archive version you'd like to upgrade to
#. Extract the binary archive from the previous step and go into the ``bin/upgrade`` folder
#. Run the ``upgrade-target`` script
#. Change to the target folder and run the ``post-upgrade.sh`` script

Here's an example of running the upgrade script ``upgrade-target`` from  a new binary archive:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ./upgrade-target.sh /path/of/install/to/be/upgraded

|

Here's an example of running the ``post-upgrade.sh`` script:

    .. code-block:: bash

       ./post-upgrade.sh

|

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Example upgrading using the upgrade script from a new binary archive

Let's take a look at an example of upgrading a CrafterCMS version 4.1.0 install (located in ``/Users/myuser/crafter-4.1.0``) to version 4.1.1 using the upgrade script from 4.1.1

After downloading and extracting CrafterCMS version 4.0.0 to ``/Users/myuser/crafter-4.1.1``, we are now ready to start upgrading by running the ``upgrade-target`` script from the 4.1.1 binary archive.

    .. code-block:: bash

.. _upgrade-using-current-install:

---------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade by running the upgrade script from your current install
---------------------------------------------------------------
CrafterCMS version 3.1.x, excluding version 3.1.0,  contain the upgrade scripts required to upgrade your install. Here's the description for the script we are going to use:

    .. code-block:: bash

        usage: start-upgrade [options]
        -h,--help                 Show usage information
        -p,--bundle-path <path>   The path of the Crafter binary archive in the
                                  filesystem. If you specify this path the URL
                                  and version parameter will be ignored
        -u,--bundle-url <url>     The URL of the Crafter binary archive to download. If
                                  you specify this URL the version parameter will
                                  be ignored
        -v,--version <version>    The community version of the Crafter binary archive to
                                  download

|

where:
   ``[options]`` is optional.

The ``start-upgrade`` script downloads the CrafterCMS version that you specify that you would like to upgrade to, then creates a script ``upgrade`` in ``{Crafter-CMS-install-directory}/temp/upgrade`` that performs the upgrade.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Steps for upgrading using the upgrade script from your current install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To upgrade your current CrafterCMS install:

#. Go to your ``bin/upgrade`` folder
#. Run the ``start-upgrade`` script. The ``start-upgrade`` script downloads the CrafterCMS binary archive version you would like to upgrade to. This will create a script ``upgrade.sh`` in ``{Crafter-CMS-install-directory}/temp/upgrade``.
#. Go to ``{Crafter-CMS-install-directory}/temp/upgrade`` and run the ``upgrade.sh`` script
#. Go to ``{Crafter-CMS-install-directory}/bin/upgrade`` and run the ``post-upgrade.sh`` script

      .. note::
         CrafterCMS 4.0.0 requires Java JDK 11. When upgrading to CrafterCMS version 4.0.0 from a 3.1.x version, remember to switch your JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to Java JDK 11 before running the ``post-upgrade`` script

#. Delete the``{Crafter-CMS-install-directory}/temp/upgrade`` once your upgrade has been completed successfully

Here's an example to perform an upgrade of your current install to a certain version

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ ./start-upgrade.sh -v 4.0.0
        $ cd ../../temp/upgrade
        $ ./upgrade.sh


|

Here's an example to perform an upgrade of your current install using a binary archive  url

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ ./start-upgrade.sh -u https://download/url/to/binary/archive
        $ cd ../../temp/upgrade
        $ ./upgrade.sh

|

Here's an example to perform an upgrade of your current install using the path where your binary archive was downloaded

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ ./start-upgrade.sh -p /path/to/binary/archive
        $ cd ../../temp/upgrade
        $ ./upgrade.sh

|

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Example running the upgrade script from your current install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's take a look at an example of upgrading a CrafterCMS version 4.1.0 install (located in ``/Users/myuser/crafter``) to version 4.1.1 using the upgrade script in 4.1.0

We'll perform an upgrade of 4.1.0 (current install) to 4.1.1

CrafterCMS has an upgrade manager that automatically upgrades the system, some configuration files and blueprints on startup. It uses a pipeline of handlers to upgrade various subsystems.

Note that the OpenSearch index will be automatically updated by the CrafterCMS upgrade manager whenever the OpenSearch index settings are updated, for example, a new field has been added for a release.
The updated index containing the new settings will be named the current index version name incremented by 1, e.g. let’s say the current index is ``mysite-authoring_v1``, after the upgrade, the new index will now be ``mysite-authoring_v2``.
