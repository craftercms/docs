=====================================
Simple Delivery Kubernetes Deployment
=====================================

CrafterCMS has an example Kubernetes deployment for a Delivery with a single instance, which you can get from https://github.com/craftercms/kubernetes-deployments/tree/master/delivery/cluster. This guide covers how to install this example in a Kubernetes cluster.

.. important::
   This guide assumes you have a working understanding of Kubernetes

------------
Requirements
------------

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the ``kubectl`` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube: https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube.

The nodes in your cluster should at least have 4 CPUs and 16 GB of space, to avoid performance issues and out of memory errors. In Minikube, to start a node with this characteristics, you can run a command similar to the following:
``minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 16384``.

In addition to that, you need an Authoring pod with a project published to ``live`` to pull site content from.

.. important::
   If you need to setup an Authoring environment, refer to :ref:`setup-simple-authoring-with-kubernetes-deployment`. **DO NOT** use :ref:`setup-studio-clustering-with-kubernetes-deployment`, which is not compatible with this guide.

------------------------
Setup Kubernetes Secrets
------------------------

The deployment files cloned from https://github.com/craftercms/kubernetes-deployments/ have a folder set aside for placing confidential information, ``kubernetes-deployments/delivery/simple/resources/secrets``.

If you previously setup Authoring with Git SSH access:

* Copy the ``id_rsa`` and ``id_rsa.pub`` files from ``kubernetes-deployments/authoring/simple/resources/secrets/git-ssh-server`` to ``kubernetes-deployments/delivery/simple/resources/secrets/git-ssh-server``

If you previously setup Authoring with Git HTTPS access:

* Copy the ``server.crt`` file from ``kubernetes-deployments/authoring/simple/resources/secrets/git-https-server`` to ``kubernetes-deployments/delivery/simple/resources/secrets/git-https-server``

Please also make sure that you uncomment the Kubernetes configuration lines under ``kubernetes-deployments/delivery/simple`` that start with ``Uncomment if using the Git (HTTPS|SSH) server`` (comment the configuration related to the other protocol).

--------------------
Start the Deployment
--------------------

Create the ``craftercms`` namespace if it doesn't exist yet.

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  kubectl create namespace craftercms
      namespace/craftercms created

If using ``minikube``, pre-pull the Authoring and OpenSearch images to avoid ``context deadline exceeded`` errors (change ``CRAFTERCMS_VERSION`` for the actual Crafter version, e.g. 4.1.1).

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  minikube image pull craftercms/delivery_tomcat:4.0.2
      ➜  minikube image pull opensearchproject/opensearch:2.8.0

Go to ``kubernetes-deployments/delivery/simple`` then run ``kubectl apply -k .``

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  kubectl apply -k .
      kubectl apply -k .
      secret/ssh-keys-h5244t449m created
      service/delivery-svc-headless created
      statefulset.apps/delivery created

Check the status of the Delivery StatefulSet by running ``kubectl get -n craftercms deployments``, and the status of the Pods by running ``kubectl get -n craftercms pods``.

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  kubectl get -n craftercms statefulsets
      NAME        READY   AGE
      authoring   1/1     20m
      delivery    1/1     2m10s

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  kubectl get -n craftercms pods 
      NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
      authoring-0   4/4     Running   0          21m
      delivery-0    3/3     Running   0          3m25s

Once it comes up, you will see the new pod in ``RUNNING`` status, with 3 containers ``READY``.

You can tail the logs of the ``tomcat`` and ``deployer`` containers, with the ``kubectl`` command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      kubectl logs -n craftercms -f -c CONTAINER_NAME POD_NAME

For example: ``kubectl logs -n craftercms -f -c tomcat authoring-0``

------------------------------
Bootstrap the Site in Delivery
------------------------------

You will need to run the ``init-site.sh`` in order to setup the project in Delivery. Either of the following commands will create the Deployer site target and create the index in Elasticsearch.

If Authoring is running with the Git SSH server container:

* Run ``kubectl exec -n craftercms -it delivery-0 --container deployer -- gosu crafter ./bin/init-site.sh -k /opt/crafter/data/ssh/id_rsa SITE_NAME ssh://authoring-svc-headless/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/SITE_NAME/published``

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜ kubectl exec -n craftercms -it delivery-0 --container deployer -- gosu crafter ./bin/init-site.sh -k /opt/crafter/data/ssh/id_rsa mysite ssh://authoring-svc-headless/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/mysite/published
      Creating Deployer Target...

      SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
      SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
      Target created successfully

  .. include:: /includes/ssh-private-key.rst

If Authoring is running with the Git HTTPS server container:

* Run ``kubectl exec -n craftercms -it delivery-0 --container deployer -- gosu crafter ./bin/init-site.sh -u crafter -p crafter SITE_NAME https://authoring-svc-headless/repos/sites/SITE_NAME/published``

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜ kubectl exec -n craftercms -it delivery-0 --container deployer -- gosu crafter ./bin/init-site.sh -u crafter -p crafter mysite https://authoring-svc-headless/repos/sites/mysite/published
      Creating Deployer Target...

      SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
      Target created successfully

   .. important::
      The example configuration files include the Git HTTPS credentials in plain text, for simplicity. If setting up Delivery in production, make sure to properly create the credentials as Secrets.

After a minute or two, the Deployer should have pulled the project content from Authoring (you can check it by getting the Delivery Deployer log: ``kubectl logs -n craftercms -c deployer delivery-0``).

You can now access the project in Delivery, by forwarding a local port to port 8080 of the pod, with the ``kubectl port-forward`` command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      kubectl port-forward -n craftercms pods/POD_NAME LOCAL_PORT:POD_PORT

Here's an example of forwarding local port 9080 to the 8080 port of the ``delivery-0`` pod:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  kubectl port-forward -n craftercms pods/delivery-0 9080:8080
      Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9080 -> 8080
      Forwarding from [::1]:9080 -> 8080

We can now view the project in Delivery from the pod by entering ``localhost:9080?crafterSite=mysite`` in your browser.

Also, now when making a change in Authoring and publishing it, the change will be reflected in Delivery after a minute.
