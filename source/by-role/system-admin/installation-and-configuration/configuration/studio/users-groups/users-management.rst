Once the dialog is displayed, to edit a specific user, simply click on the field that you want to change.
In the above dialog the **Externally Managed** label is displayed which indicates that the user is externally
managed such as the case in LDAP. Notice that since the user is externally managed, the only change that
can be made for the user is the group membership.

For the user dialog displayed below, since the user is not externally managed, all the fields can be changed
for the user. In this dialog, you can modify the user information such as email, first name, last name and
user name, group membership, reset the user's password and delete the user. You can also activate/de-activate
the user currently being viewed by clicking on the slider labeled **Enabled**. Edit the fields you
want to change and then click on the "**Save**" button. If you do not want to edit the user, please click
on the "Cancel" button.

.. important::
   When a user is deleted, the deleted user cannot be re-created. Instead of deleting a user,
   we recommend disabling the user, which prevents them from connecting to the system.

   To disable a user, simply click the ``Enabled`` slider to turn it off and a notification snack
   bar at the bottom will appear informing you that the user has been disabled successfully.
