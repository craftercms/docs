A node is a server running an instance of Crafter Studio and a cluster consists of two or more nodes. In the image above, two Crafter Studio instances are clustered as primary and replica.

When setting up a Studio cluster, a specific node needs to be started first as a
reference point, then the other node/s can join and form the cluster. This is known as cluster bootstrapping.
Bootstrapping is the first step to introduce a node as Primary Component, which others will see as a reference
point to sync up with.

The Primary Component is a central concept on how to ensure that there is no opportunity for database inconsistency or
divergence between the nodes in case of a network split. The Primary Component is a set of nodes that communicate
with each other over the network and contains the majority of the nodes. There's no Primary Component yet when starting
up a cluster, hence the need of the first node to bootstrap the Component. The other nodes will then look for the
existing Primary Component to join.

   .. note::
      Studio nodes use an in-memory distributed data store to orchestrate the bootstrapping of the Primary Component, so
      you don't need to do it. When the cluster is started, the nodes synchronize through the data store to
      decide which one does the bootstrapping, and then the rest join the Primary Component.

Once the cluster is up, one node in the cluster is elected to be the primary and the rest of the node(s) as replica(s).
Deployment processors can be configured when Studio Clustering is setup.

------------
Requirements
------------
Before we begin configuring Studio for clustering, the following must be setup:

* A load balancer or DNS server directing traffic to the primary node, and can failover to the replica node if the primary is not healthy

|hr|

-------------
Configuration
-------------
First, we'll take a look at an example of :ref:`how to setup a two node cluster with Studio <setup-a-two-node-cluster-with-studio>`
step by step, then, we'll take a look at an example of :ref:`setting up Studio clustering using a Kubernetes deployment <setup-studio-clustering-with-kubernetes-deployment>`

.. _setup-a-two-node-cluster-with-studio:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Setup a Two Node Cluster with Studio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this section, we'll look at an example of how to setup a two node cluster with Studio.

To setup a two node cluster with Studio we'll need to do the following:

#. Configure Nodes in the Cluster
#. Start the Nodes in the Cluster

""""""""""""
Requirements
""""""""""""
* At least 2 servers running Linux (Remember that Studio's cluster runs only in Linux)
* Enterprise version of CrafterCMS
* Studio's clustering requires the ``libssl1.0.0`` (or ``libssl1.0.2``) shared library.
  Some Linux distros does not come with the library pre-installed and may need to be installed.


""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Configuring Nodes in the Cluster
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
#. Install the Enterprise version of CrafterCMS on all the nodes
#. Configure the Git **repository clustering** for all nodes by configuring the following settings in the
   ``studio-config-override.yaml`` file.

   Uncomment and leave the value of  **studio.clustering.node.registration.localAddress** as
   ``${env:CLUSTER_NODE_ADDRESS}`` (you will configure the node address in a later step), then configure the
   repository authentication:

   - **studio.clustering.node.registration.authenticationType**: authentication type to access this server's local
     repository
   - **studio.clustering.node.registration.username**: username to access this server's local repository
   - **studio.clustering.node.registration.password**: password to access this server's local repository

      .. note::
         You can use the node's default SSH keys, located in ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` and ``~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``, if you set
         the ``authenticationType`` to ``none``. You can also use ``~/.ssh/config`` if you need to configure certain
         aspects of SSH authentication, like ``StrictHostKeyChecking``. For example, you can disable
         ``StrictHostKeyChecking`` for hostnames with ``*.hostnamespace`` so that you don't need to validate the SSH host
         keys before running Studio:

         .. code-block:: none

            Host *.hostnamespace
                StrictHostKeyChecking no

#. Create a Hazelcast configuration file in ``shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/hazelcast-config.yaml``.

   Studio uses Hazelcast as the in-memory distributed data store to orchestrate the bootstrapping of the MariaDB cluster.
   You can find more about Hazelcast in `<https://hazelcast.org/>`_ and its configuration in
   `<https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#understanding-configuration>`_.
   In this configuration file you specify the way the nodes discover each other in the Hazelcast cluster.

   We recommend you create a simple configuration in each node with the list of addresses of the cluster nodes:

   .. code-block:: yaml
      :caption: *bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/hazelcast-config.yaml*

      hazelcast:
        network:
          join:
            multicast:
              enabled: false
            tcp-ip:
              enabled: true
              member-list:
                - 192.168.56.1
                - 192.168.56.114

   |

   If using Kubernetes, Studio also supports configuration through the
   `Kubernetes Hazelcast Plugin  <https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes>`_:

   .. code-block:: yaml
      :caption: *bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/hazelcast-config.yaml*

      hazelcast:
        network:
          join:
            multicast:
              enabled: false
            kubernetes:
              enabled: true
              namespace: default
              service-name: authoring-service-headless
              resolve-not-ready-addresses: true

   |

      .. note::
         Please apply the ``rbac.yaml`` mentioned in the
         `Kubernetes Hazelcast Plugin  <https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes>`_ documentation
         in your Kubernetes cluster, before even starting any Studio pods.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Starting the Nodes in the Cluster
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
After finishing the node configurations, we are now ready to start the cluster. Please start the cluster nodes
in close succession, one after the other. If you take more than 5 minutes to start all the cluster nodes then
the nodes already running will timeout while trying to synchronize for bootstrapping (you can configure this
timeout in the ``bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml`` file,
under the property ``studio.db.cluster.nodes.startup.wait.timeout``).

.. _configuring-the-deployer-for-studio-clustering:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Configuring the Deployer for Studio Clustering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. version_tag::
    :label: Since
    :version: 4.1.1

The deployer is cluster aware and is able to run deployment processors based on the value set in the deployment processor property ``runInClusterMode`` (described :ref:`here <crafter-deployer-administration>`) and the value returned by the Studio `clusterMode <../../../../_static/api/studio.html#tag/cluster/operation/getClusterMode>`__ API.

The ``runInClusterMode`` property can be configured for any processor in the deployer target context xml, e.g:

.. code-block:: xml
    :caption: *base-target-context.xml*

    ...
    <bean id="gitDiffProcessor" parent="deploymentProcessor"
          class="org.craftercms.deployer.impl.processors.git.GitDiffProcessor">
        <property name="localRepoFolder" value="${target.localRepoPath}"/>
        <property name="blobFileExtension" value="${deployer.main.targets.config.blob.file.extension}"/>
        <property name="processedCommitsStore" ref="processedCommitsStore"/>
        <property name="runInClusterMode" value="ALWAYS" />
    </bean>

|

Or in the target yaml configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: *{site}-authoring.yaml example file*

    ...

    - processorName: searchIndexingProcessor
      excludeFiles: ['^/sources/.*$']
      runInClusterMode: "ALWAYS"

|

Remember that the `clusterMode <../../../../_static/api/studio.html#tag/cluster/operation/getClusterMode>`__ API needs the ``studioManagementToken`` configured in the target like below:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: *Sample STUDIO configuration in the base-target.yaml*

    target:
      ...
      ...
      studioUrl: http://localhost:8080/studio
      studioManagementToken: ${deployer.main.management.studioAuthorizationToken}
      ...
      ...

|

The deployment processor configured above runs whenever the ``clusterMode`` returned is not ``UNKNOWN`` and meets one of the following conditions:

- ``runInClusterMode`` is set to ``ALWAYS``
- ``runInClusterMode`` value matches the current ``clusterMode``

|hr|

--------
Failover
--------
Studio clustering is based on Primary/Replica clustering mechanics. Failure scenarios:

- Replica node(s) failure: In case of one or more replicas failing, the cluster will continue to work normally. New replicas can join and catch up.
- Primary node failure: In case of the primary node failing, the load balancer or DNS must either automatically or manually redirect or repoint traffic to the next healthy node.

    - The replicas will automatically perform an election and appoint a new primary. The new primary's health check will report that it's ready to receive traffic, the load balancer or DNS can then redirect or repoint traffic to the new primary.
    - As a new node or the old failed primary rejoin the cluster, they'll assume a replica role and catch up with the new primary.

Crafter Studio provides a health check endpoint at ``/studio/api/2/monitoring/status?token={your management token}``. You can use this endpoint to check the health of any node in the cluster. This can be used to facilitate automatic failover.

.. _cluster-multi-region-considerations:

---------------------------
Multi-Region Considerations
---------------------------
For clusters with nodes in multi-regions utilizing S3 buckets, AWS provides solutions for handling multi-region
deployments of S3 buckets.

AWS supports access points for managing access to a shared bucket on S3.
For more information on Amazon S3 Access Points, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html

For clusters with S3 buckets located in multiple AWS regions, Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points provide a global
endpoint that applications can use to fulfill requests from.
For more information on Multi-Region Access Points in Amazon S3, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiRegionAccessPoints.html

AWS S3 also supports bucket replication (S3 replication) irrespective of the region they belong to, which provides data
protection against disasters, minimizing latency, etc. For more information on S3 bucket replication for use with
multi-region access points, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiRegionAccessPointBucketReplication.html

Here's some more information on S3 replication: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/amazon-s3-replication-adds-support-two-way-replication/

------------------
Backup and Restore
------------------
CrafterCMS comes with a script to backup and restore your environment, as described :ref:`here <backup-and-restore>`

There are a couple of ways to backup and restore your cluster:

- Shutdown the cluster first then back up the Primary and the Replicas and restore both nodes when necessary
- Shutdown the cluster first then backup and restore only 1 node (Primary or Replica), which will become
  Primary. You then have to add a Replica using the instructions :ref:`here <adding-a-new-node-to-cluster>`.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Via the Global Transaction ID
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
On a primary server, all database updates are written into the binary log as binlog events. A replica server
connects to the primary and reads the binlog events, then applies the events locally to replicate
the changes in the primary. For each event group (transaction) in the binlog, a unique id is attached
to it, called the ``Global Transaction ID`` or ``GTID``.

To check our cluster, we can check the ``gtid_current_pos`` system variable in the primary and
the ``gtid_slave_pos`` system variable in the replica.

The ``gtid_current_pos`` system variable contains the GTID of the last transaction applied to the database
for each replication domain. The value is read-only, but it is updated whenever a transaction is written
to the binary log and/or replicated by a replica thread, and that transaction's GTID is considered newer
than the current GTID for that domain.

The ``gtid_slave_pos`` system variable contains the GTID of the last transaction applied to the database by the server's replica threads for each replication domain. This system variable's value is automatically updated whenever a replica thread applies an event group.

To learn more about the global transaction ID, see https://mariadb.com/kb/en/gtid/

To check the ``gtid_current_pos`` and ``gtid_slave_pos`` system variables, log into MariaDB with the
``mysql`` client from the primary or the replica:

#. From the command line in the server, go to ``$CRAFTER_HOME/bin/dbms/bin`` and run the ``mysql`` program

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./mysql -S /tmp/MariaDB4j.33306.sock

   |

#. Inside the MySQL client, run the following:

   *Primary*: ``SELECT @@GLOBAL.gtid_current_pos;``

   .. code-block:: none

An email will also be sent to the configured list of recipients to inform them of the failure.

See the :ref:`setup-a-two-node-cluster-with-studio` article then scroll to the
:ref:`failure notification properties <authoring-cluster-startup-failure-notification-config>` section
for more information on how to configure the list of recipients to be informed in case of a
startup failure in the authoring cluster.

This section discusses how to fix the sync failure in your authoring cluster.

"""""""""""""""""""""""
Fixing the Sync Failure
"""""""""""""""""""""""
The first thing to do when a sync failure happens is to figure out whether the sync failure is in the DB or Git.
The email sent to configured recipients when the sync failure happened will indicate whether it's a DB or a Git
sync failure. From the logs, you can also determine if it was a DB or a Git sync failure.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DB sync failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For a DB sync failure, the logs will contain a message like below:

.. code-block:: text

   ...
   Failed to start DB replica:
   ...

as seen :ref:`above <authoring-cluster-troubleshooting-git-sync-fail-log>` and the following email will be sent if configured:

Before performing any valid intervention on the database, it will need to be started first, then the user needs to login.

#. The first thing that needs to be done is to start the database. To start the database, run the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      CRAFTER_HOME/bin/dbms/bin/mysqld --no-defaults --console --basedir=CRAFTER_HOME/bin/dbms --datadir=CRAFTER_HOME/data/db --port=33306 --socket=/tmp/MariaDB4j.33306.sock --max_allowed_packet=128M --max-connections=500

   This is the output when running the command above:

   .. code-block:: bash

      /opt/crafter/bin/dbms/bin/mysqld --no-defaults --console --basedir=/opt/crafter/bin/dbms --datadir=/opt/crafter/data/db --port=33306 --socket=/tmp/MariaDB4j.33306.sock --max_allowed_packet=128M --max-connections=500

#. Login to the database by running the following command then entering the database root password:

   .. code-block:: bash

      CRAFTER_HOME/bin/dbms/bin/mysql -u <db_root_user> -p --socket=/tmp/MariaDB4j.33306.sock

   |

   The <db_root_user> by default is ``root`` with password set to ``root`` or empty. Remember to replace
   <db_root_user> with the actual ``root`` user (MARIADB_ROOT_USER) value and enter the actual password
   (MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWD) value used in your system, which can be found in the ``crafter-setenv.sh`` file
   under the ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin`` folder.

   In the sample run below, the default root user ``root`` is used and the corresponding password:

   .. code-block:: text

      ./mysql -u root -p --socket=/tmp/MariaDB4j.33306.sock
      Enter password:

The intervention on the database may now be performed once the admin is logged in to the database.
After performing the fix, stop the database then restart the node.

If an admin reviews the node states and thinks everything is fine but still receives DB sync errors, the admin
may decide if MariaDB should ignore those errors and continue. To ignore the errors, a manual intervention is
required and may be done by following the instructions `here <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/set-global-sql_slave_skip_counter/>`__

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Git sync failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For a Git sync failure, the logs will contain a message like below:

.. code-block:: text

   ...
   Branch 'master' in repository '/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/ed123/sandbox/.git' has commits ahead of the primary node
   ...

as seen :ref:`above <authoring-cluster-troubleshooting-git-sync-fail-log>` and the following email will be sent if configured:

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/cluster-git-sync-fail.webp
   :alt: CrafterCMS - Studio Enterprise Clustering Git sync failure email
   :width: 35%

|

If there is any divergent history, the node will fail to startup and the admins would need to remove any commits
"ahead" of primary branch. That would apply for all repositories (global, site sandbox, site published).

After reviewing the logs (tomcat logs and git log), there are a few ways to go about fixing the sync problem:

- Manually remove the extra commits, do a ``git reset --hard``
- Manually move the extra commits into the primary corresponding repository
- Shutdown new primary and start the failing one as primary

.. _changing-the-cluster-git-url:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Changing the Cluster Git URL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When the cluster Git URL for syncing members is changed after a cluster has been setup and started, the nodes on the disk may contain the old URL format when starting up. The following error appears in the log when switching the URL from SSH to HTTPS:

   .. code-block:: text

      [ERROR] 2021-03-12T18:54:02,887 [pool-5-thread-10] [job.StudioClockExecutor] | Error executing Studio Clock Job
      java.lang.ClassCastException: org.eclipse.jgit.transport.TransportHttp cannot be cast to org.eclipse.jgit.transport.SshTransport

   |

To sync the Git URL format on disk with the new format set in the config, the remotes will need to be recreated

To recreate a remote:

#. Stop the cluster
#. Update the configuration file with the desired URL format in all your nodes

   .. code-block:: yaml
      :caption: *bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml*

      # Cluster Git URL format for synching members.
      # - Typical SSH URL format: ssh://{username}@{localAddress}{absolutePath}
      # - Typical HTTPS URL format: https://{localAddress}/repos/sites
      studio.clustering.sync.urlFormat: ssh://{username}@{localAddress}{absolutePath}

   |

#. Remove the remotes in all your nodes via the command line interface using ``git`` in the ``global`` repo and the ``sandbox`` and ``published`` repos of all the sites in the cluster.

   The global repo is located in *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/global*, the ``sandbox`` repo of a site is located in *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/<site-name>/sandbox* and the ``published`` repo of a site is located in  *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/<site-name>/published*

   The cluster remote names are available from ``Cluster`` in the Studio global menu.

   .. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/cluster-upgraded.webp
      :alt: Studio Clustering Screen - Remote names of nodes listed in Studio Main Menu - Cluster
      :width: 100%
      :align: center

   |

   Remember to only remove the cluster remotes. Cluster remote names start with ``cluster_``. See example below:

   .. code-block:: sh
      :caption: *List of remotes for the sandbox repository of site video*
      :emphasize-lines: 2, 3

      $ git remote -v
      cluster_node_192.168.1.103	ssh://myuser@192.168.1.103/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/video/sandbox (fetch)
      cluster_node_192.168.1.103	ssh://myuser@192.168.1.103/opt/crafter/data/repos/sites/video/sandbox (push)
      origin	https://github.com/craftercms/video-center-blueprint.git (fetch)
      origin	https://github.com/craftercms/video-center-blueprint.git (push)

   |

   To remove a remote, run ``git remote rm <remote_name>``, where ``remote_name`` is the name of remote as seen from the ``Cluster`` screen in the Studio Main Menu. Let's use the remote name ``cluster_node_192.168.1.103`` for our example on removing a remote

   .. code-block:: sh
      :caption: *Remove remote*

      $ git remote rm cluster_node_192.168.1.103

   |

   To verify the remotes are gone on disk, view the current remotes and make sure that the list does not contain a remote with a name beginning with ``cluster_xxxx``:

   .. code-block:: sh
      :caption: *View current remotes*

      $ git remote -v
      origin	https://github.com/craftercms/video-center-blueprint.git (fetch)
      origin	https://github.com/craftercms/video-center-blueprint.git (push)


   |

#. Start the cluster.
   Once the cluster is started, the remotes will be recreated. Verify that the URL format displayed in ``Cluster`` in the Studio global menu is the desired URL format.
