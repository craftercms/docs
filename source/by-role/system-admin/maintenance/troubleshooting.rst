-----------------------------
Troubleshooting Search Issues
-----------------------------
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How Search Works
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CrafterCMS uses OpenSearch as the backing search engine. Crafter Deployer indexes the content and keeps OpenSearch up to date with the latest changes. Crafter Engine uses OpenSearch to perform search queries.

.. image:: /_static/images/search/search-mechanics.webp
   :alt: Crafter Studio Search Mechanics
   :align: center

"""""""""""""""""
Indexing Process:
"""""""""""""""""
#. Authors create or update content in Crafter Studio
#. Studio writes and/or publishes the content
#. The Deployer picks up the changes in a particular target (which is the combination of site/environment). Then:

	* On preview update, the Deployer inspects the ``sandbox`` and resolves the changes by doing a file diff between the last Git commit it processed
	  and the latest commit in the ``sandbox``
	* On publish, Studio moves the changes to ``published`` and the Deployer in delivery pulls the changes

#. A processor of the target in the Deployer sends a request to search with the XML or content to index

"""""""""""""""""
Querying Process:
"""""""""""""""""
A. The end-user makes a request to Crafter Engine.
B. Crafter Engine components requiring queries issue a query to search where filters will be added to the query and then executed.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Places Search Indexing Can Get Hung Up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Communication Between Crafter Studio & Crafter Deployer

	* Crafter Studio will notify the Deployer when content has changed
	* Ensure that the Deployer is pulling the changes
	* If the Deployer is not receiving any changes, check network connectivity and ports

* Communication Between Crafter Deployer & OpenSearch

	* The Deployer has a target with a Search Processor
	* Ensure that the processor is configured to the proper HOST, PORT for OpenSearch

* Communication Between Crafter Engine & OpenSearch

	* Crafter Engine is configured to talk to OpenSearch
	* Ensure that Crafter Engine is configured to the proper HOST, PORT for OpenSearch

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reviewing Log Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to figure out which of the possible failures described in the previous section happened,
you should review the following log files for each one of the components:

+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
|| Component        || Log Files                                        |
+===================+===================================================+
|| Crafter Studio   || ``CRAFTER/logs/tomcat/catalina.out``             |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
|| Crafter Deployer || ``CRAFTER/logs/deployer/deployer.out``           |
||                  || ``CRAFTER/logs/deployer/deployer-general.log``   |
||                  || ``CRAFTER/logs/deployer/{target}-{env}.log``     |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
|| Crafter Engine   || ``CRAFTER/logs/tomcat/catalina.out``             |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Configure Deployer Port & Search Port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To configure the Deployer and Search port, open the file ``CRAFTER/bin/crafter-setenv.sh``

.. code-block:: bash

  export DEPLOYER_PORT=${DEPLOYER_PORT:="9191"}

  export SEARCH_HOST=${SEARCH_HOST:="localhost"}
  export SEARCH_PORT=${SEARCH_PORT:="9201"}

---------------------------------
Troubleshooting Publishing Issues
---------------------------------
When publishing fails, here are some things to consider to help track down the cause of publishing issues.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Inspect Publishing Queue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The publishing queue (items that are in the queue for publishing) can be viewed through Studio from the publishing icon at the top bar, or, |projectTools| -> ``Publishing``, then scroll down to the ``Publishing Queue``. Here, the user can narrow down the queue for inspection by specifying filters. For more information see :ref:`publishing-queue`

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Publishing Issues When Moving Projects Around in Disk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Publishing may fail when moving projects around in disk. When moving projects around, the reference between the ``published`` repository and the ``sandbox`` repository may not be valid anymore. To resolve the issue, the reference between the ``published`` repository and the ``sandbox`` repository needs to be updated.

Typically, the configuration for the ``published`` repository can be found in the file ``path_to_published_repo/published/.git/config`` and the reference to ``sandbox`` may look like this:

.. code-block:: text

    [remote "origin"]
	    url = ../sandbox
	    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

|

In some cases, the configuration looks like this:

.. code-block:: text

    [remote "origin"]
	    url = /my/absolute/path/to/crafter_install/crafter-auth-env/bin/../data/repos/sites/mysite/sandbox
	    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

|

To manually fix the configuration problem, either set the url value as a relative path between the ``published`` and the ``sandbox`` repositories (default ``../sandbox``) or set it as the absolute path of the ``sandbox`` repository.

.. _debugging-deployer-issues:

-------------------------------
Troubleshooting Deployer Issues
-------------------------------
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Unknown Host Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When configuring a Deployer target to connect to a remote host through SSH you might encounter the following error:

.. code-block:: java

	com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: UnknownHostKey: SERVER_NAME. RSA key fingerprint is 50:db:75:ba:11:2f:43:c9:ab:14:40:6d:7f:a1:ee:e3

|

This normally means that the SSH host key from the remote server is stored in ECDSA format instead of RSA, under ``known_hosts``.
The Deployer requires the host key to be RSA. To fix this do the following:

#. Delete the ``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` file for the user that's running the Deployer.
#. Connect to the remote server with the following command to add the RSA key: ``ssh -o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa SERVER_NAME``.

^^^^^^^^^^
Git Errors
^^^^^^^^^^
If the ``published`` folder in the Authoring installation became corrupted or had a Git issue that required manual intervention, and
the Deployer in Delivery is still pulling from that folder, there's a good probability that the Delivery repository has pull/merge
errors. If you see these errors in the log, after fixing the Authoring ``published`` repository, you can do a ``git reset --hard``
in the Delivery repository. This will reset the repository to the latest successful commit, and the Deployer will pull the changes
again from Authoring. You can also reset to a specific commit with ``git reset --hard <commit-hash>``.

You might also see Git diff errors when the Deployer is executing the ``GitDiffProcessor``. This means that the the changes
between the last processed commit and the last pulled commit could not be calculated. To fix this, go to ``data/deployer/processed-commits``
and locate the ``.commit`` file for the site. If you know the hash of the last correctly processed commit, update the value and the
Deployer will automatically process from that commit to the latest. If you don't know, delete the file and the Deployer will reprocess
from the initial commit, but **beware because this normally means that all files will be reprocessed/reindexed**.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Connection Timed Out
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the Deployer is not able to clone the remote repository and an error like below appears in the logs:

.. code-block:: java

    org.eclipse.jgit.errors.TransportException: ssh://jdoe@authoring-server/path/to/repo: Connection timed out (Connection timed out)
        at org.eclipse.jgit.transport.JschConfigSessionFactory.getSession(JschConfigSessionFactory.java:159)
        at org.eclipse.jgit.transport.SshTransport.getSession(SshTransport.java:137)
        at org.eclipse.jgit.transport.TransportGitSsh$SshFetchConnection.<init>(TransportGitSsh.java:274)
        at org.eclipse.jgit.transport.TransportGitSsh.openFetch(TransportGitSsh.java:169)
        at org.eclipse.jgit.transport.FetchProcess.executeImp(FetchProcess.java:136)
        at org.eclipse.jgit.transport.FetchProcess.execute(FetchProcess.java:122)

        at org.eclipse.jgit.api.FetchCommand.call(FetchCommand.java:213)
        ... 15 common frames omitted

|

Try a manual clone from the command line: `git clone ssh://jdoe@authoring-server/path/to/repo`

If the manual clone works, it's very probable that there's a proxy between the servers. The Deployer currently does not support connections through proxies but might get support in a future update.

^^^^^^^^
Low Disk
^^^^^^^^
When OpenSearch disk utilization goes above the configured high disk watermark (default is 90%), errors in creating
indexes for Deployer targets may appear and the following message will appear in your OpenSearch logs:

.. code-block:: text
    :caption: *OpenSearch Logs - High disk watermark exceeded*

    2024-10-08 02:13:37 [2024-10-09T06:13:37,787][WARN ][o.o.c.r.a.DiskThresholdMonitor] [30afa082cf18] Putting index create block on cluster as all nodes are breaching high disk watermark. Number of nodes above high watermark: 1.
    2024-10-08 02:13:37 [2024-10-09T06:13:37,855][WARN ][o.o.c.r.a.AllocationService] [30afa082cf18] Falling back to single shard assignment since batch mode disable or multiple custom allocators set
    2024-10-08 02:13:37 [2024-10-09T06:13:37,980][WARN ][o.o.c.r.a.DiskThresholdMonitor] [30afa082cf18] high disk watermark [90%] exceeded on [Hvfsz707SbiNkljIdIu-2w][30afa082cf18][/usr/share/opensearch/data/nodes/0] free: 39.8gb[8.5%], shards will be relocated away from this node; currently relocating away shards totalling [0] bytes; the node is expected to continue to exceed the high disk watermark when these relocations are complete

|

To  increase the high disk watermark, set the ``cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high`` property in
*CRAFTER_HOME/bin/opensearch/config/opensearch.yml*, to desired value. Say we want to increase the high disk watermark
to 95%, add the following to your OpenSearch configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: *Example increasing high watermark to 95% in CRAFTER_HOME/bin/opensearch/config/opensearch.yml*

    cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high: 0.95

.. _debugging-ssh-issues:

------------------------------
Troubleshooting SSH Key Issues
------------------------------
In this section, we present a few errors that a user may encounter when using ssh keys with CrafterCMS and how to fix the errors.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SSH Unknown Host
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When configuring a Deployer target to connect to a remote host through SSH you might encounter the following error:

.. code-block:: java

	Caused by: org.apache.sshd.common.SshException: Server key did not validate

|

This normally means that the server is not in the known_host file. To fix this run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh-keyscan {server url} >> crafter-authoring/data/ssh/known_hosts

|

To test your SSH config, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh -F crafter-authoring/data/ssh/config -o UserKnownHostsFile=crafter-authoring/data/ssh/known_hosts -T {server url}

|

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Remote Repository Not Found: USERAUTH fail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here's another error you may encounter in the logs when creating a site with a link to a remote repository using SSH keys:

.. code-block:: java

    org.apache.sshd.common.SshException: USERAUTH fail

|

This could mean that a passphrase was setup for the SSH keys. Crafter currently doesn't support using a passphrase with SSH keys. To fix the error, remove the passphrase from the SSH key.

There are a couple of ways to remove the passphrase from the SSH key:

#. Delete your existing key and generate a new key with NO PASSPHRASE.
#. Or, another way is to run the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

       $ ssh-keygen -p

   |

   It will then prompt you to enter the keyfile location (``CRAFTER_HOME/data/ssh`` by default), the old passphrase, and the new passphrase (leave this blank to have no passphrase).

------------------------------------
Troubleshooting SSL Handshake Issues

This means your application is doing a connection with a version prior to TLSv1.2

**Please check the documentation of the library performing the connection to see if there's a way to enforce TLSv1.2 or higher** (for example, when using a MySQL JDBC driver you can enforce it by adding the ``enabledTLSProtocols=TLSv1.2`` parameter to your connection string).

If you must use TLSv1 or TLSv1.1, you can re-enable the disabled versions by removing "TLSv1" and/or "TLSv1.1" from the ``jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms`` security property in the ``java.security`` configuration file.

Let's take a look at an example of re-enabling TLSv1 and TLSv1.1.

Look for the ``java.security`` file in ``JDK_INSTALL_HOME/conf/security``, and go to the property ``jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms``:

.. code-block:: properties
    :caption: *Example of jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property with TLSv1 and TLSV1.1 disabled*

    jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, RC4, DES, MD5withRSA, \
    DH keySize < 1024, EC keySize < 224, 3DES_EDE_CBC, anon, NULL, \
    include jdk.disabled.namedCurves

|

To re-enable the versions, remove ``TLSv1`` and ``TLSv1.1`` from the property ``jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms``

.. code-block:: properties
    :caption: *Example of re-enabling TLSv1 and TLSV1.1*

    jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DES, MD5withRSA, \
    DH keySize < 1024, EC keySize < 224, 3DES_EDE_CBC, anon, NULL, \
    include jdk.disabled.namedCurves
