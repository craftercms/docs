====================================
Commandline Access to Crafter Studio
====================================

.. TODO Will CrafterCLI make this article obsolete or at least it references that?
   If we were to keep this, should we call it Automating Crafter Studio or CLI Access to Studio?

.. TODO Use CrafterCLI [insert link], otherwise
    See below if you want to do it manually

In this section, we'll show the basics of interacting with Crafter Studio APIs by performing the following:

#. Authentication
#. Get a list of projects under management
#. Write content to a project

Weâ€™ll use CURL, a ubiquitous Linux command tool as our client.

You can find the full Crafter Studio API for CrafterCMS :ref:`here<crafter-studio-api>`

Let's begin:

#. **Authentication**

   There are two authentication methods that can be used: JWT and HTTP Basic

   .. _access-tokens:

   **JWT Authentication**

   .. version_tag::
      :label: Since
      :version: 4.0.0

   JWT is a widely adopted standard for secure authentication and is the preferred way.
   HTTP Basic is simple but not as secure as JWT and for that reason it is disabled by default. However, it can be very
   useful for local development environments.

   In both authentication methods you need to know the credentials of a user with the right permissions depending on
   the operations that you need to execute. For this example we will generate a token for the ``admin`` user but in
   a real scenario you should create a user with the least amount of permissions possible.

   .. note::

     Not all users have the required permission ``manage_access_token`` to create access tokens.
     If the ``Token Management`` tool is not shown in the global menu you will need to request the permission or an
     access token from a system administrator.

   |

   If you already have an access token you can skip to step 5, otherwise follow all steps to **create a new
   token**:

   1. Login to Crafter Studio

      .. figure:: /_static/images/jwt/global-menu.webp
        :width: 70%
        :alt: Crafter Studio - Global Menu
        :align: center

      |

   2. Open the ``Token Management`` tool

      .. figure:: /_static/images/jwt/token-management.webp
        :width: 70%
        :alt: Crafter Studio - Token Management
        :align: center

      |

   3. Create a new access token

      The only required field for the access token is the label to identify it, however, it is also recommended to set
      an expiration date to minimize the risk of lost or stolen tokens being used without being noticed.

      .. figure:: /_static/images/jwt/create-token.webp
        :width: 70%
        :alt: Crafter Studio - Create Access Token
        :align: center

      |

      Once the expiration date is reached the access token will stop working automatically.

      .. figure:: /_static/images/jwt/create-token-2.webp
        :width: 70%
        :alt: Crafter Studio - Access Token Expiration
        :align: center

      |

   4. Copy the value of the access token

      The value of the access token will not be stored on the server, so it needs to be stored by the user in a safe
      place as it is impossible to recover it after it is created.

      If an access token is lost or exposed in any way it should be disabled or completely deleted to avoid any
      possible use.

      .. figure:: /_static/images/jwt/token-management-2.webp
        :width: 70%
        :alt: Crafter Studio - Token Management
        :align: center

      |

   5. Include the access token with all requests

      Most HTTP clients provide built-in support for access token athentication, in the case of curl you will need
      to use the header option ``--header`` or ``-H``

      ``curl -H 'Authentication: Bearer <access token>' ...``

   |

   .. _http-basic-authentication:

   **HTTP Basic Authentication**

   If HTTP Basic authentication is already enabled you can skip step 1 and start using the credentials:

   1. Enable HTTP Basic auth and restart Crafter Studio

      Update the Crafter Studio configuration override: from Crafter Studio ``Global Menu > Global Config`` or directly
      from the global repository ``$CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/global/configuration/studio-config-override.yaml``

      Adding the following property:

      .. code-block:: yaml

        # Indicates if HTTP Basic auth should be enabled for the API
        studio.security.http.basic.enabled: true

      |


   2. Include the credentials with all requests

      Most HTTP clients provide an easy way to use HTTP Basic, in the case of curl you can use the user options
      ``--user`` or ``-u``

      ``curl -u <username>:<password> ...``

#. **Get a list of projects under management**

   We'll get a list of sites the user is authorized to work with
   :ref:`crafter-studio-api-site-get-per-user`

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl <authentication option> -X GET http://localhost:8080/studio/api/1/services/api/1/site/get-per-user.json?username=admin

   |

   After issuing the CURL command you will get a response that contains sites your user has access to:

   .. code-block:: json

      {"sites":[{"id":9,"siteId":"ar","name":"ar","description":"","status":null,"liveUrl":null,"lastCommitId":"951004363449cc83209f307b1e9f110dab37fed7","publishingEnabled":1,"publishingStatusMessage":"idle|Idle","lastVerifiedGitlogCommitId":null},{"id":5,"siteId":"diiot","name":"diiot","description":"","status":null,"liveUrl":null,"lastCommitId":"92d543eaa164b1ebfbdd6ce538ae028d4d6421b7","publishingEnabled":0,"publishingStatusMessage":"idle|Idle","lastVerifiedGitlogCommitId":"92d543eaa164b1ebfbdd6ce538ae028d4d6421b7"},{"id":10,"siteId":"editorialcom","name":"editorialcom","description":"","status":null,"liveUrl":null,"lastCommitId":"503d922f226e8ab821073e23ef5a229f907212a0","publishingEnabled":1,"publishingStatusMessage":"","lastVerifiedGitlogCommitId":"503d922f226e8ab821073e23ef5a229f907212a0"},{"id":3,"siteId":"flow","name":"flow","description":"","status":null,"liveUrl":null,"lastCommitId":"21923775c3a1fc778a364d47884b9ee2bb4928a5","publishingEnabled":1,"publishingStatusMessage":"idle|Idle","lastVerifiedGitlogCommitId":"21923775c3a1fc778a364d47884b9ee2bb4928a5"},{"id":8,"siteId":"vr","name":"vr","description":"","status":null,"liveUrl":null,"lastCommitId":"c67fd9dd25d1aa59ff13e3fda2a4387be50dfc69","publishingEnabled":1,"publishingStatusMessage":"idle|Idle","lastVerifiedGitlogCommitId":null}],"total":6}

   |

   The response above contains a number of projects. In the next call we will write a content object to one of the projects (editorialcom.) To do this we need the site ID. We get this from the response above: **editorialcom**

#. **Write content to a project**

   We'll now write content to the Editorial com Project
   :ref:`crafter-studio-api-content-write-content`

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl <authentication option> -d "<page><content-type>/page/category-landing</content-type><display-template>/templates/web/pages/category-landing.ftl</display-template><merge-strategy>inherit-levels</merge-strategy><file-name>index.xml</file-name><folder-name>test3</folder-name><internal-name>test3</internal-name><disabled >false</disabled></page>" -X POST "http://localhost:8080/studio/api/1/services/api/1/content/write-content.json?site=editorialcom&phase=onSave&path=/site/website/test3/index.xml&fileName=index.xml&user=admin&contentType=/page/category-landing&unlock=true"

   |

   In the call above note:

   We are passing in content as the POST body. The content is in XML format. In CrafterCMS, content objects are stored as simple XML documents.
   We are passing a number of parameters that tell CrafterCMS where and how to store the content in the repository

Using the above examples as a guide, we can now interact with any Crafter Studio API found :ref:`here <crafter-studio-api>`
