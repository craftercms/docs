=============================================
Adding a Default Screenshot to a Project/Site
=============================================
CrafterCMS uses a default path (``YOUR_SANDBOX/.crafter/screenshots/default.png``), to look for a default representative
image of a project/site, as seen in the **Projects** screen:

.. image:: /_static/images/developer/plugins/default-screenshots.webp
   :alt: *Projects screen with default screenshots*
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

|

Projects/sites without a default screenshot are displayed in the **Projects** screen with just the project name and a
red background like below for the project named ``Ed``:

.. image:: /_static/images/developer/plugins/screenshot-not-set.webp
   :alt: *Projects screen with no default screenshot for project Ed*
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

|

To add or change the default screenshot of your project/site, there are two options:

#. Directly accessing the sandbox folder to create the default file location and then committing it using ``git``

   First, you'll need to create the folder structure/path that CrafterCMS uses to check for a default screenshot,
   ``/host/path/to/projects/repos/sites/SITENAME/sandbox/.crafter/screenshots/``, if it doesn't exist yet. Next, you'll
   need to add your default screenshot named ``default.png``.

   After adding ``default.png`` under the directory structure you just created, you'll need to add and commit your
   changes by using git so Studio is aware of the changes made.
   To commit your changes , head to ``/host/path/to/projects/repos/sites/SITENAME/sandbox`` to git add your default
   screenshot file, then commit your changes like below:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd /host/path/to/projects/repos/sites/SITENAME/sandbox/
       git add .crafter/screenshots/default.png
       git commit -m "<the commitâ€™s description>"

   Refresh your browser and you should now be able to see the default image you just committed in the ``Projects`` screen.

#. Pushing the project/site into a remote repository and create the default image file in remote, committing it, and
   then pulling it back to Studio, using Studio's :ref:`Git project tool <project-tools-git>`.

   To push your project into a remote repository using Studio's :ref:`Git project tool <project-tools-git>`, follow the
   instructions for adding a remote bare git repository in the
   :ref:`Studio Administration section <create-project-based-on-a-blueprint-then-add-a-remote-bare-git-repository>`.
   Your project should now have a remote repository listed in the ``Remote Repository`` tab of the Git project tool screen.
   The next step is to push the project to the remote repository by clicking on the ``Push`` button (button with the
   up arrow) next to the remote repository. In the remote repository, create the file ``.crafter/screenshots/default.png``
   and commit the change. Finally, back in Studio's :ref:`Git project tool <project-tools-git>`, pull the
   changes in to Studio from the remote repository by clicking on the ``Pull`` button (button with the down arrow).

   Refresh your browser and you should now be able to see the default image you committed in the remote repository in
   the ``Projects`` screen.
