CrafterCMS' Experience Builder (XB) provides a UI layer on top of your applications that enables authors
with in-context editing (ICE) for all the model fields defined in the content types of pages and components.
CrafterCMS developers must integrate their applications with XB, essentially telling XB what field of the
model each element on the view represents. See :ref:`content-modeling` to learn more about the model.

.. TODO insert <figure: example page with a sample content type side by side showing the relation between page elements
   and content type fields>

If you`re starting from a 3.x ICE system, see :ref:`upgrading-in-context-editing` for more information on how
to move from the 3.x ICE system to the 4.x Experience Builder (XB) system discussed here.

----------------------------------------------
Creating Experience Builder (XB) Enabled Sites
----------------------------------------------
The concrete integration strategy with XB depends on what kind of application you are developing, however,
overall all you need to do is mark the content element that display CrafterCMS content and initialize XB.
CrafterCMS provides native XB integration for FreeMarker and React applications. Other types of
applications (e.g. Angular, Vue, etc.) can be integrated with XB through the underlying libraries
that power the FreeMarker and React applications. For reference on how to integrate, please see the
sections below for your specific kind of application.

To integrate with XB, all you need to do is:

* Register or mark CrafterCMS content field elements: you tell the system what HTML element represents
  any give model field. Registration can be manual (i.e. invoking specific methods from the XB JavaScript
  libraries), or by putting a specific set of attributes on each tag.
* Initialize XB. Which can also be done manually or by invoking specific methods of the XB JavaScript
  libraries.

Overall, XB's ICE engine works with a coordinate system that you — the developer — use to
tell the CMS which field of the content type each element/component on your page/app maps to.

The coordinate system consists of the following pieces of data:

* **Path**: the path to the content item (e.g. ``/site/components/features/main_feature.xml``)
* **Model ID (a.k.a. object ID, local ID)**: the internal GUID that every content object in CrafterCMS has
  (e.g. ``5a06e244-64f4-4380-8619-1c726fe38e92``)
* **Field ID**: the ID of the field in the content type (e.g. ``heroTitleText_t``)

  * Field IDs may be compound, comprised of the full path to that field when such field is nested within repeat
    groups (e.g. ``carouselSlides_o.slideTitle_t``)

* **Index**: When working with collections (e.g. component selectors or repeat groups), the index of the item within
  it's container collection (e.g. ``0``)

  * Indexes can be compound, comprised of the full path of indexes to that item in the collection (e.g. ``0.1``)

XB's ICE engine requires, at times, what might be considered slightly more verbose markup structure.
In order for the system to be able to direct authors to every piece of the model, as well as allowing
them to edit inline, you need to register each piece of the model as an element on your view.

For example, consider a carousel, where the carousel is modelled as a CrafterCMS component that has
a repeat group field called ``slides_o`` which has two inner fields called ``caption_s`` and ``image_s``.

The markup for a carousel may look like this:

.. code-block:: html

     <div class="carousel">
       <div class="slide">
         <img src="slide1.png" alt="">
         <h2>Slide One</h2>
       </div>
       <div class="slide">
         <img src="slide2.png" alt="">
         <h2>Slide Two</h2>
       </div>
     </div>

In order to register each piece of the model, we would need to introduce a new element.

.. code-block:: html

   <div class="carousel">              <!-- Component (Carousel) -->
     <div>                             <!-- Repeating group (slides_o) — Additional element introduced -->
       <div class="slide">             <!-- Repeat group item (slides_o[0]) -->
         <img src="slide1.png" alt=""> <!-- Repeat group item field (slides_o[0].images_s) -->
         <h2>Slide One</h2>            <!-- Repeat group item field (slides_o[0].caption_s) -->
       </div>
       <div class="slide">             <!-- Repeat group item (slides_o[1]) -->
         <img src="slide2.png" alt=""> <!-- Repeat group item field (slides_o[1].images_s) -->
         <h2>Slide Two</h2>            <!-- Repeat group item field (slides_o[1].caption_s) -->
       </div>
     </div>
   </div>

You can vary exactly where to add this additional element to suit your needs — or those of the libraries
and frameworks that you use to develop your applications. The important aspects are that each field is
represented by an element on the page/app and that the hierarchy of the fields is followed by the
hierarchy of your markup.

Meaning, the component element is the parent of the repeat group element which is a parent of the repeat group items
which are parents of the repeat group item fields, as shown below:

.. code-block:: text

  component
    repeat-group
      item
        item-fields

For example, you could move the additional ``div`` to be the top wrapper, and hence represent the component
instead of the repeat group. Naturally, the repeat group would then be represented by the ``div`` with the
carousel class.

.. code-block:: html

   <div>                    <!-- Component (Carousel) -->
     <div class="carousel"> <!-- Repeating group (slides_o) -->
       ...
     </div>
   </div>

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
XB Integration Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The HTML element that is registered with XB as a field must contain only that content, unwrapped.

  * Elements that represent fields of type text, html and other simple values, should print the content
    value directly inside of them without intermediate elements.

  * Elements that represent collections (i.e. repeat groups or component collections), must have their
    item elements as direct children.

                     </div>
                  </div>

* XB makes available a set of classes and JavaScript to help in best supporting
  the authoring experience of your applications.

   * ``craftercms-ice-on``: When edit mode is active, the ``html`` element gets this class.
   * ``craftercms-ice-bypass``: When/while the ``z`` key is pressed, the ``html`` element gets this class.
   * ``craftercms-highlight-move``: When edit mode is active and mode is *move*, the ``html`` element gets this class.
   * ``craftercms-highlight-all``: When edit mode is active and mode is *edit* (not move), the ``html`` element gets this class.
   * Empty fields  are likely to have a height/width of 0 pixels, making them invisible for authors trying to edit those fields.
     XB makes available classes to be added to the the container element of the field which will add some padding and text content
     making the empty element visible and indicating is an empty field to catch the author's attention. The specific styles can be
     customized using the ``globalStyleOverrides`` prop of the :ref:`ExperienceBuilder` component either directly when using React,
     or through the ``props`` argument of the :ref:`freemarker-initExperienceBuilder` macro.
      * ``craftercms-empty-collection``: Use it for collection type fields such as repeat groups and item selectors.
      * ``craftercms-empty-field``: Use it for simple fields such as text, html, etc.
   * ``craftercms-drag-n-drop-active``: When drag and drop is active, the ``html`` element gets this class.
   * ``craftercms-edit-mode-padding``: When padding mode is active, the ``html`` element gets this class. You may use the class to
     conditionally add padding during edit mode to the elements that may be hard to reach for authors due to the html structure and
     resulting rendering.
   * ``data-craftercms-event-capture-overlay``: Elements like video players or iframes can sometimes interfere with the normal flow of
     pointer events and make it challenging for authors to access in-context editing for the field. Adding this **attribute** to an element
     wrapping one of these event-capturing elements (e.g. an iframe), will put styles in place to prevent it from blocking XB from getting
     the necessary pointer events for authors to edit the model. See also :ref:`eventCaptureOverlay` for usage on Freemaker.
   * ``craftercms.editMode``: When edit mode is turned on/off, XB will dispatch this custom event on the ``document`` object. You can
     listen to this event to trigger custom actions when the edit mode is turned on/off. For example, turn off a carousel from auto-rotating
     which could make it challenging for authors to edit. The event detail will be a boolean indicating if the edit mode is on or off.
   * ``craftercms.xb:loaded``: When XB is fully loaded and ready to be used, XB will dispatch this custom event on the ``document`` object.
     You can listen to this event to trigger custom actions when XB is fully loaded and ready to be used. For example, use a function that's
     part of the ``craftercms.xb`` global (e.g. `craftercms.xb.getICEAttributes({ ... })`), which might not be available before XB is loaded.
   * ``craftercms.iceBypass``: On the ``z`` (XB bypass key) keydown or keyup, XB will dispatch this custom event on the ``document`` object.
     You can listen to this event to trigger custom actions when ``z`` is pressed. The event detil will be a boolean indicating if the key is pressed or not.

.. _xb-freemarker:

^^^^^^^^^^
FreeMarker
^^^^^^^^^^
In FreeMarker applications, in order to integrate with XB, you will use the macros provided by CrafterCMS,
which in turn will set all the right hints (i.e. html attributes) on the markup for
the ICE engine to make things editable to authors.

As mentioned earlier, you need to give XB's ICE engine the *coordinates* to identify each model/field,
so, in addition to their other arguments, each macro receives the following base parameters:

.. _xbAttributes:

* **Model** (``$model``)

  * By providing the model, internally CrafterCMS extracts the path and model ID (a.k.a object ID)
  * Model is optional since by default it uses the ``contentModel`` FreeMarker context variable for the current template

    * If you need to use a different model, please specify the ``$model`` argument of the macros

  * The HTML attributes for it are ``data-craftercms-model-path`` and ``data-craftercms-model-id``

* **Field ID** (``$field``)

  * The HTML attribute for it is ``data-craftercms-field-id``.

* **Index** (``$index``)

  * The HTML attribute for it is ``data-craftercms-index``.

For example, the following ``div`` element macro

.. code-block:: text

   <@crafter.div $field="columns_o.items_o" $index="0.1">
     ...
   </@crafter.div>

The above will print out to the HTML a ``div`` with all the relevant hints for the ICE engine to pick up
this element as editable. Such ``div`` would look as shown below:

.. code-block:: html
   :linenos:

       <div
         data-craftercms-model-path="/site/website/index.xml"
         data-craftercms-model-id="f830b94f-a6e9-09eb-9978-daafbfdf63ef"
         data-craftercms-field-id="columns_o.items_o"
         data-craftercms-index="0.1"
       >...</div>

    Start by importing the crafter FreeMarker library on to your FreeMarker template.

.. code-block:: text

   <#import "/templates/system/common/crafter.ftl" as crafter />

Once you've imported ``crafter.ftl``, you can start converting tags to editable elements by switching
each of the tags that represent CrafterCMS content model fields, from plain HTML tags to a macro tag.
Will use the previous carousel example to illustrate.

As seen on the previous section, we introduced an additional element to represent the repeat group
and we ended up with the following markup.

.. code-block:: html
   :linenos:

       <div class="carousel">              <!-- Component (Carousel) -->
         <div>                             <!-- Repeating group (slides_o) — Additional element introduced -->
           <div class="slide">             <!-- Repeat group item (slides_o[0]) -->
             <img src="slide1.png" alt=""> <!-- Repeat group item field (slides_o[0].images_s) -->
             <h2>Slide One</h2>            <!-- Repeat group item field (slides_o[0].caption_s) -->
           </div>
           <div class="slide">             <!-- Repeat group item (slides_o[1]) -->
             <img src="slide2.png" alt=""> <!-- Repeat group item field (slides_o[1].images_s) -->
             <h2>Slide Two</h2>            <!-- Repeat group item field (slides_o[1].caption_s) -->
           </div>
         </div>
       </div>

Assume you're using a particular *CarouselJS* library that requires the ``div.carousel`` element to be
the direct parent of the ``div.slide`` elements. As mentioned earlier, we can flip around the elements
for the component and the repeat group.

.. code-block:: html
   :linenos:

       <div>                    <!-- Component (Carousel) -->
         <div class="carousel"> <!-- Repeating group (slides_o) -->
           ...
         </div>
       </div>

Now, to start converting the elements to be editable, replace each tag, with the appropriate CrafterCMS macro.
Prepend ``@crafter.`` to every tag so that ``<div>…</div>`` becomes ``<@crafter.div>...</@crafter.div>``,
``<h1>`` becomes ``<@crafter.h1>``, ``<img>`` becomes ``<@crafter.img>``, ``span`` becomes ``<@crafter.span>``
and so on.

Exceptions to this are the following:

* For repeat group field elements and their children, use ``@crafter.renderRepeatGroup``.
* For item selector controls that hold components to be rendered, use ``@crafter.renderComponentCollection``.

To convert the carousel example, first, mark the component root by using ``@crafter.div``.
See :ref:`htmlElementTagMacros` for all the available customizations and configuration.

.. code-block:: text

   <#import "/templates/system/common/crafter.ftl" as crafter />
   <@crafter.div>
     ...
   </@crafter.div>

Next, let's do the repeat group and its items. We use ``@crafter.renderRepeatGroup`` to render repeat
groups. :ref:`renderRepeatGroup` for all the available customizations and configuration.

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

       <@crafter.renderRepeatGroup
         $field="slides_o"
         $containerAttributes={ "class": "carousel" }
         $itemAttributes={ "class": "slide" };
         item, index
       >
         <@crafter.img
           $field="slides_o.image_s"
           $index="${index}"
           src="${item.image_s}"
           alt=""
         />
         <@crafter.h2 $field="slides_o.caption_s" $index="${index}">
           ${item.caption_html!''}
         </@crafter.h2>
       </@crafter.renderRepeatGroup>

    The ``renderRepeatGroup`` macro does several things for us:


* Prints the repeat group *container element*
* Prints the repeat group *item elements*
* Per-item, prints out what you pass down as the body (i.e. ``<#nested />``) to the macro

  * It provides you with the ``item`` and ``index`` for each item, so you can use them appropriately as if you were
    iterating manually.

The complete FreeMarker template for the carousel component becomes:

.. code-block:: text
   :linenos:

       <#import "/templates/system/common/crafter.ftl" as crafter />
       <@crafter.componentRootTag>
         <@crafter.renderRepeatGroup
           $field="slides_o"
           $containerAttributes={ "class": "carousel" }
           $itemAttributes={ "class": "slide" };
           item, index
         >
           <@crafter.img
             $field="slides_o.image_s"
             $index="${index}"
             src="${item.image_s!''}"
             alt=""
           />
           <@crafter.h2 $field="slides_o.caption_s" $index="${index}">
             ${item.caption_html!''}
           </@crafter.h2>
         </@crafter.renderRepeatGroup>
       </@crafter.componentRootTag>

.. _xbMacros:

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
FreeMarker Macros & Utilities
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
There are three macros in ``crafter.ftl``:

- ``head``: used to inject templates from plugins
- ``body_top``: used to inject templates from plugins
- ``body_bottom``: used to inject templates from plugins and is also used by ICE as detailed below

The ``head``, ``body_bottom`` and ``body_top`` are macros that should be positioned in those positions that the
name suggests. Their purpose is to print strategic scripts, stylesheets or otherwise executions that should
take place in those moments of the page rendering or be printed in that position.
Plugins use these “hooks” to inject themselves on the right location so it’s important for ftl templates to
position them in accordance to their name. For example, a Google Tag Manager plugin will want to get injected
early on in the ``head`` so it will print it’s script in the ``<@head />`` hook.


See :ref:`here <plugins-using-freemarker-templates>` for more information on injecting templates from plugins.

|

After importing ``crafter.ftl``, you'll have all the available XB macros described below.

.. code-block:: text

   <#import "/templates/system/common/crafter.ftl" as crafter />

.. _freemarker-initExperienceBuilder:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
initExperienceBuilder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Initializes the ICE engine and the communication between the page/app and studio. Call is required to
enable Studio to control the page and for XB to enable ICE.

The ``initExperienceBuilder`` macro is automatically invoked by the ``<@crafter.body_bottom />`` but you can opt out
of it by invoking body_bottom with ``initializeInContextEditing=false``.

.. code-block:: text

   <@crafter.body_bottom initializeInContextEditing=false />

In that case, you'll need to invoke ``initExperienceBuilder`` manually.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 10 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   * - isAuthoring
     - boolean
     - Optional as it defaults to :ref:`modePreview <printIfPreview>` FreeMarker context variable. When isAuthoring=false, in context editing is skipped all together. Meant for running in production.
   * - props
     - JS object string
     - This is passed directly to the JavaScript runtime. Though it should be passed to the macro as a string, the contents of the string should be a valid JavaScript object. Use it to configure/customize Crafter's JavaScript SDK initialization.

When invoked, ``initExperienceBuilder`` returns an object with an ``unmount`` prop/function, which
would indeed `unmount` XB from the current page.

.. _htmlElementTagMacros:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HTML Elements Tag Macros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CrafterCMS provides a comprehensive list of macros for the most common html elements that are used to
develop content-managed websites/webapps. All these tags provided are essentially an alias to the
underlying ``@crafter.tag`` macro, which you can use when you wish to use an element that isn't provided
in the out-of-the-box macros (e.g. if you're using custom html elements), or if you need to set which
tag to use dynamically (see examples below).

The following tags are available:

``article``, ``a``, ``img``, ``header``, ``footer``, ``div``, ``section``, ``span``, ``h1``, ``h2``, ``h3``, ``h4``, ``h5``,
``h6``, ``ul``, ``p``, ``ul``, ``li``, ``ol``, ``iframe``, ``em``, ``strong``, ``b``, ``i``, ``small``, ``th``, ``caption``, ``tr``,
``td``, ``table``, ``abbr``, ``address``, ``aside``, ``audio``, ``video``, ``blockquote``, ``cite``, ``em``, ``code``, ``nav``,
``figure``, ``figcaption``, ``pre``, ``time``, ``map``, ``picture``, ``source``, ``meta``, ``title``

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``$model``
     - The content model for which this element belongs to. ``$model`` is defaulted to the ``contentModel`` FreeMarker
       template context variable denoting the current page or component, so in most cases it is not necessary
       to specify it. This is only required to be specified if you're trying to use a different model than the default
   * - ``$field``
     - The field ID on the content type definition of the current model. When inside repeat groups,
       a dot-separated-string of the full field *path* to the present field (e.g. ``slides_o.image_s``)
   * - ``$index``
     - When inside a collection (i.e. repeat group or component collection), the index of the present item. When nested
       inside repeat groups, the full index *path* to this item (e.g. ``0.1``)
   * - Html attributes
     - For convenience, macro tags will print out to the HTML all the attributes you pass to them that aren't one of
       the Crafter custom arguments (i.e. ``$model``, ``$field``, etc). For example, if you have
       ``<div class="carousel">``, you can convert to a Crafter tag like ``<@crafter.div class="carousel" ...>``.
       If you use attributes that go against FreeMarker syntax (e.g. ``data-my-attribute="foo"``), use the
       ``$attributes`` argument of the macros instead
   * - ``$attributes``
     - Html attributes to print on to the element. Particularly useful for attributes that you can't supply to
       the macro as a direct argument due to FreeMarker syntax restrictions. For example, ``<div data-foo="bar">``,
       transforming it as ``<@crafter.div data-foo="bar" ...>`` would produce a FreeMarker exception;
       use ``<@crafter.div $attrs={ "data-foo": "bar" } ...>`` instead
   * - ``$tag``
     - Specify which tag to use. For example ``<@crafter.tag $tag="article"... />`` will print out an
       ``<article>`` tag. Use only if you're using ``@crafter.tag``, which in most cases you don't need to as you
       can use the tag alias (e.g. ``<@crafter.article ... />``)
   * - ``renderEmpty``
     - By default set to true. When true, even if the value is blank (or not preset), the macro
       will still print out the tag. When false, the macro will not print out the tag.
   * - ``defaultValue``
     - A value to use when the field is blank (or not preset).

''''''''
Examples
''''''''
In this first example:

 - The template's model root tag has no ``$field`` parameter as it is not a field; it represents the model itself.
 - Specifying ``$model`` is not required in most cases because by default the macros use the ``model`` variable
   (set automatically by the system on the rendering template's scope, containing the current template's model).
 - Finally the ``$index`` parameter is not used in either tags, since neither is an item of a collection.

.. code-block:: text
   :emphasize-lines: 1

       <@crafter.section>
         <@crafter.h1 $field="heading_t">${model.heading_t}</@crafter.h1>
       </@crafter.section>

    In this example, the html tag is printed dynamically using what's specified on the content model.

.. code-block:: text
   :emphasize-lines: 1

       <@crafter.tag $tag=(contentModel.headingLevel_s!'h2')>
         <@crafter.span $field"text_s">${model.text_s}</@crafter.span>
       </@crafter.tag>

''''''''''
Auto-print
''''''''''
The example below, uses the short-hand auto-print expression. The colon at the end of the field id,
instructs the system to print the value of that field for you.

.. code-block:: text

   <@crafter.h1 $field"title_t:" />
                             -^- notice the `:`

The above is equivalent to ``<@crafter.h1 $field"title_t">${model.title_t!""}</@crafter.h1>``. By default,
auto-print renders to the ``innerHTML``, but you can print to an attribute by putting the target attribute
after the colon.

.. code-block:: text

   <@crafter.img $field"image_s:src" />

Note the ``@crafter.img`` macro automatically prints to ``src`` when you don't supply the render target; hence,
``<@crafter.img $field"image_s:" />`` is equivalent to ``<@crafter.img $field"image_s:src" />``.


.. note::
   Auto-print can only be used to print top-level model field values.



.. _renderComponentCollection:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
renderComponentCollection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Used to render *Item Selector* controls, which hold components. Internally, it prints out the
tag for the field (item selector) and the tags for each of the component container items.

The way component collections are modelled on the ICE engine are in the following hierarchy:

.. code-block:: text

   <FieldTag>
     <Item0>
       <ComponentTag>
         ...
     <Item1>
       <ComponentTag>
         ...
     <Item2>
       <ComponentTag>
         ...

Note that the item tag is not the component tag itself, instead, the component is contained by the item and it's
not the item.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameters
     - Description
   * - ``$model``
     - The content model for which this element belongs to. ``$model`` is defaulted to the ``contentModel`` FreeMarker
       template context variable denoting the current page or component, so in most cases it is not necessary
       to specify it. This is only required to be specified if you're trying to use a different model than the default
   * - ``$field``
     - The field ID on the content type definition of the current model. When inside repeat groups,
       a dot-separated-string of the full field *path* to the present field (e.g. ``slides_o.image_s``)
   * - ``$index``
     - When inside a collection (i.e. repeat group or component collection), the index of the present item. When nested
       inside repeat groups, the full index *path* to this item (e.g. ``0.1``)
   * - ``$fieldCarryover``
     - When nested inside repeat groups, a dot-separated-string of the full field *path* to the present field
       (e.g. ``repeatOne_o.repeatTwo_s``) **without the current field itself**, as the macro puts them together.
   * - ``$indexCarryover``
     - When nested inside repeat groups, the full index *path* to this control (e.g. ``0.1``).
   * - ``$collection``
     - Contains the collection that the macro iterates through internally. By default, it is set to ``$model[$field]``,
       so not required to specify in most cases; however, you can manually specify the collection that will be looped
       when invoking the macro if you need to.
   * - ``$containerAttributes``
     - Html attributes to print on to the **field** element.
   * - ``$containerTag``
     - The tag to use for the **field** element.
   * - ``$itemTag``
     - The tag to use for the **item**  tags.
   * - ``$itemAttributes``
     - Html attributes to print on to the **item** elements.
   * - ``$nthItemAttributes``
     - Html attributes to print by item index. For example, ``$nthItemAttributes={ 0: { "class": "active" } }`` will
       apply the class named active only to the first item in the collection.
   * - ``renderComponentArguments``
     - CrafterCMS' :ref:`renderComponent <renderComponent>` macro supports supplying additional arguments
       (``additionalModel`` argument when used directly) to the component template context. You can send these via
       this parameter. The ``renderComponentArguments`` will be sent to all items.

.. code-block:: text

   <@crafter.renderComponentCollection $field="mainContent_o" />

The sample above would print out the following html:

.. _renderRepeatGroup:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
renderRepeatGroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Used to render *Repeat Group* controls. Internally, it prints out the
tag for the field (repeat group) and the tags for each of the items.

The way repeat group collections are modelled on the ICE engine are in the following hierarchy:

.. code-block:: text

   <FieldTag>
     <Item0>
         ...
     <Item1>
         ...
     <Item2>
       <ComponentTag>
         ...
     ...

Repeat groups introduce the possibility of having complex/compound ``$field`` and ``$index`` arguments when they
contain nested repeat groups or component collections.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameters

.. _eventCaptureOverlay:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
eventCaptureOverlay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Elements like video players (e.g. a YouTube embed, an iframe) can sometimes interfere with the normal flow of pointer events
and make it challenging for authors to access the in-context editing for the field being represented by these elements.

The ``eventCaptureOverlay`` macro prints out an element with styles to overlay an stop the inner element from capturing
pointer events when in Edit mode.

.. code-block:: html

   <@crafter.eventCaptureOverlay $onlyInPreview=true $tag="section" class="craftercms-overlay-example">
      <@crafter.tag
         $tag="iframe"
         id="ytplayer"
         type="text/html"
         width="640"
         height="360"
         src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7lc1UVf-VE?autoplay=1&origin=http://example.com"
         frameborder="0"
      ></@crafter.iframe>
   </@crafter.eventCaptureOverlay>

The `iframe` tag macro includes the event capture overlay by default, so the above can be achieved simply by using ``@crafter.iframe``.

.. code-block:: html

   <@crafter.iframe
      id="ytplayer"
      type="text/html"
      width="640"
      height="360"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7lc1UVf-VE?autoplay=1&origin=http://example.com"
      frameborder="0"
   ></@crafter.iframe>

You may disable the overlay for the iframe macro by setting the `$omitEventCaptureOverlay`
attribute to `true` or specify the eventCaptureOverlay macro arguments using the `$eventCaptureOverlayProps`.

.. _forEach:

~~~~~~~
forEach
~~~~~~~
Useful for iterating through crafter collections.

''''''''
Examples
''''''''
.. code-block:: text

   <@crafter.forEach contentModel.slides_o; slide, index>
     <#assign
       attributesByIndex = attributesByIndex + { index: { "data-bs-interval": "${slide.delayInterval_i?c}" } }
     />
   </@crafter.forEach>

.. code-block:: text

       data-bs-slide-to="${index}"
       aria-label="Slide ${index}"
       ${(initialActiveSlideIndex == index)?then('class="active" aria-current="true"', '')}
     ></button>
   </@crafter.forEach>

.. _cleanDotNotationString:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cleanDotNotationString
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Takes a dot-separated-string and returns a string that doesn't have any dots at the beginning or
end of the string and that there aren't any consecutive dots.

Useful when working with repeat groups in Crafter as these introduce the possibility of field/index
carryovers and complex/compound fields (e.g. ``field1.field2``) and indexes (e.g. ``0.1``).

.. code-block:: text

   <#assign str1 = ".hello." />
   <#assign str2 = ".world." />
   ${crafter.cleanDotNotationString("${str1}.${str2}")}
   <#-- Output is hello.world -->

.. code-block:: text

   ${crafter.cleanDotNotationString("...foo...bar..")}
   <#-- Output is foo.bar -->

.. code-block:: text

   ${crafter.cleanDotNotationString("..")}
   <#-- Output is an empty string -->

.. _isEmptyCollection:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
isEmptyCollection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Receives a Crafter collection and returns true if it's empty or false otherwise.

.. _emptyCollectionClass:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
emptyCollectionClass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Receives a collection and, if the collection is empty it will print a *special* crafter class,
otherwise, it won't print anything. This macro only prints in Crafter Engine's *preview mode*.

The *special* class adds styles to the element so that it has a minimum height and
width so that authors can visualize the area and drag components on it despite being empty — as otherwise,
it would be invisible and virtually not editable.

One should use this macro on empty component or repeat group collections.

**Component collection**

.. code-block:: text

   <@crafter.renderComponentCollection
     $field="mainContent_o"
     $containerAttributes={ "class": crafter.emptyCollectionClass(contentModel.mainContent_o) }
   />

**Repeat group**

.. code-block:: text

   <@crafter.renderRepeatGroup
     $field="slides_o"
     $containerAttributes={ "class": crafter.emptyCollectionClass(contentModel.slides_o) }
   />

.. _emptyFieldClass:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
emptyFieldClass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Receives a field value and, if the field has no content it will print a *special* crafter class,
otherwise, it won't print anything. This macro only prints in Crafter Engine's *preview mode*.

The *special* class adds styles to the element so that it has a minimum height and
width so that authors can visualize the area and add content to this field — as otherwise,
it would be invisible and virtually not editable.

One should use this macro on empty fields.

**Example**

.. code-block:: text

   <@crafter.h1
      class="display-5 fw-bold ${crafter.emptyFieldClass(contentModel.title_s)}"
      $field="title_s"
   >
      ${contentModel.title_s!''}
   </@crafter.h1>

.. _printIfPreview:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
printIfPreview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Receives a string which it will print if Crafter Engine is running in preview mode. Doesn't print
anything if Engine is running the published site.

.. code-block:: html

   <#-- Import the "debug" version of the script in preview. -->
   <script src="/static-assets/js/bootstrap.bundle${crafter.printIfPreview('.debug')}.js"></script>

You can also use the FreeMarker context variable ``modePreview`` to do similar things; in fact,
``printIfPreview`` uses it internally.

.. code-block:: html

   <#-- Import a in-context editing stylesheet only in preview. -->
   <#if modePreview><link href="/static-assets/css/ice.css" rel="stylesheet"></#if>

.. _printIfNotPreview:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
printIfNotPreview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Receives a string which will be printed if Crafter Engine is **not** running in preview mode. Doesn't print
anything if Engine is running the published site.

.. code-block:: html

   <#-- Import the "minified" version of the script in delivery. -->
   <script src="/static-assets/js/bootstrap.bundle${crafter.printIfNotPreview('.min')}.js"></script>

.. _printIfNotEmpty:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
printIfNotEmpty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Receives the target value, the value to print if the target is not empty, and an optional *fallback* value to print if the target is empty.

.. code-block:: html

   <!-- Use an anchor if an href was provided, button otherwise. -->
   <#local tag = crafter.printIfNotEmpty(contentModel.href, "a", "button")>
   <#if tag == "a"><#local attributes = attributes + { "href": href }></#if>
   <@crafter.tag $tag=tag $attributes=attributes>
     <#nested>
   </@crafter.tag>

.. _notEmptyString:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _xbJsApps:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
JavaScript Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
XB offers a set of JavaScript (JS) libraries and utilities that you can use in various scenarios.
When writing JS-powered applications including Single-page applications — like when using React,
Angular, Vue or similar — all you need to do is invoke the various XB methods relevant to your application.

The simplest integration strategy for JS applications consist of marking the relevant HTML elements
which represent a content model field, with a set of attributes that CrafterCMS sdk libraries generate for you based on a content
model that you've previously fetched.

You may also dig deep into the system and manage the field element registrations manually to suit your
application needs.

"""""
Usage
"""""
XB JS libraries can be used either via npm by importing ``@craftercms/experience-builder`` or using the
JS :abbr:`UMD (Universal Module Definition)` bundle and adding it into your app's runtime.

.. _xb-react-bindings:

"""""
React
"""""
CrafterCMS provides React bindings for integrating with XB. Because XB itself is a React application,
React presents the tightest, most native integration with XB as it will essentially run as part of your
app instead of as a parallel application like when using other technologies.

React bindings can be used either via npm or using the umd bundle that comes with CrafterCMS.

The components available for using on your React applications are listed below.

.. _ExperienceBuilder:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ExperienceBuilder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the main component that orchestrates and enables all of the In-context Editing. You must declare
this component only once and it should be a parent of all the XB-enabled components.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 10 10 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Prop
     - Type
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``isAuthoring``
     - boolean
     - (Required)
     - It controls the adding or bypassing of authoring tools. Should send true when
       running in Studio and authoring tools should be enabled. Authoring tools are completely
       absent when set to false.
   * - ``isHeadlessMode``
     - boolean
     - false
     - If your App consumes content from CrafterCMS in a headless way, certain options (e.g. editing
       the freemarker template or controller) aren't applicable. Setting headless mode to true will
       disable XB options that aren't relevant to headless application such as SPAs.
   * - ``themeOptions``
     - `MUI's ThemeOptions <https://mui.com/customization/theming>`__
     - XB's defaults
     - XB is powered by MUI. This argument allows you to customize MUI theme options and override
       XB's defaults.
   * - ``sxOverrides``
     - ExperienceBuilderStylesSx
     - XB's defaults
     - You may change XB-specific theming through this argument
   * - ``globalStyleOverrides``
     - `GuestGlobalStylesProps['styles'] <https://github.com/craftercms/studio-ui/blob/develop/ui/guest/src/react/GuestGlobalStyles.tsx>`__
     - null
     - Specify style overrides for various XB global styles.
   * - ``scrollElement``
     - string
     - html, body
     - You may specify a different element for XB to scroll when scrolling the user to specific
       CrafterCMS field elements.

~~~~~
Model
~~~~~
Use this component to render elements that represent the **models themselves** (i.e. CrafterCMS pages or
components, not their fields).

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 10 10 70
   :header-rows: 1

     - Object (ContentInstance)
     - (Required)
     - The model being rendered
   * - ``component``
     - string | React.ElementType
     - "div"
     - The component to be rendered
   * - ``componentProps``
     - Object
     - undefined
     - Any props sent at the root that aren't own props are forwarded down to the rendered
       component so in most cases you needn't use ``componentProps``. There may be cases where your
       target component has a prop name that matches in name with a prop of the CrafterCMS React
       component so to avoid it swallowing the prop and not reaching your target component, you may
       send the prop(s) via ``componentProps`` instead.

~~~~~~~~~~~
ContentType
~~~~~~~~~~~
Use this component to render a specific component of your own library based on the content type of the
model. ``ContentType`` component works with a "content type map" which you must supply as a prop. The
content type map, is essentially a plain object, a lookup table of your components indexed by content
type id. You may use it in conjunction with ``React.lazy`` to optimize your app; specially considering the
content type map should contain all the possible components that you will be rendering via ``ContentType``
component on a given piece of your app.

.. list-table::

     - Object (ContentInstance)
     - (Required)
     - The model being rendered
   * - ``contentTypeMap``
     - Object
     - (Required)
     - A map of components indexed by CrafterCMS content type id. The content type id of the model passed
       will be used to pick from the map the component that should render said model.
   * - ``notFoundComponent``
     - React.ComponentType
     -
     - If the model passed to ``ContentType`` is ``null``, it's taken as a 404 and the notFoundComponent
       is rendered.
   * - ``notMappedComponent``
     - React.ComponentType
     -
     - If the content type of the model is not found in the ``contentTypeMap``, the ``notMappedComponent``
       is rendered.

~~~~~~~~~~~
RenderField
~~~~~~~~~~~
Use this component to render CrafterCMS model **fields**. Although it can also render collection-type
fields, CrafterCMS provides specific components (see below) to render component collections or repeat groups.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 10 10 70

   * - ``fieldId``
     - string
     - (Required)
     - The id of the field to render
   * - ``index``
     - string | number
     - undefined
     - If applicable, the index within the parent collections.

       component so in most cases you needn't use ``componentProps``. There may be cases where your
       target component has a prop name that matches in name with a prop of the CrafterCMS React
       component so to avoid it swallowing the prop and not reaching your target component, you may
       send the prop(s) via ``componentProps`` instead.
   * - ``renderTarget``
     - string
     - "children"
     - The value(s) to be rendered will be passed with this prop name to the target element type
       (see ``component`` prop). By default, the value is passed as children, but if you were to
       render for example an image, you would do ``<RenderField ... component="img" renderTarget="src" />``
   * - ``render``
     - function
     - (value, fieldId) => value
     - If you need to do custom rendering logic for the value of the field being rendered, you may
       supply a ``render`` function. The function receives the field value and the ``fieldId``

.. _RenderComponents:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RenderComponents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use this component to render item selectors that hold components. This component renders the field
element (i.e. the item selector), the item element, and the component itself.

     - (Required)
     - A map of components indexed by CrafterCMS content type id. The content type id of the model
       passed will be used to pick from the map the component that should render said model.
   * - ``contentTypeProps``
     - Props Object
     - {}
     - Props to be passed down to the ``ContentType`` component — which renders your target component
       based on the ``contentTypeMap``. Props will be passed all the way down to the target component.
   * - ``nthContentTypeProps``
     - Record<number, object>
     - ``{}``
     - You can pass specific props to components based on their index in the collection with this prop.
   * - ``renderItem``
     - function
     - (component, index) => <ContentType ... />
     - If the default component renderer is not sufficient for your use case, you can supply a custom
       renderer which is invoked with the current component and the current index in the collection.

.. _RenderRepeat:

~~~~~~~~~~~~
RenderRepeat
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use this component to render repeat groups and their items. This component renders the field element
(i.e. the repeat group) and the item element. The body of each repeat group item is rendered by a function
supplied by you, which is provided with the item, the index in the collection, the computed compound
index (when applicable) and the collection itself.

     - function
     - (item, index) => index
     - A function that receives the item and the current index and should return the ``key``
       (React special's prop attribute) to be used on the item being rendered. By default, just the
       current index is used, so you can make the key more robust through this prop.
   * - ``renderItem``
     - function
     - (Required)
     - Should return/render the inner item (``RenderRepeat`` renders the field and item elements,
       you're responsible for rendering the fields of each item). The function receives the item,
       the compound index (nested collections), the index in the current repeat collection and the
       collection itself.

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Angular, Vue and Other JS Applications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The easiest way to integrate XB with your JS application is by putting attributes on each HTML element that
represents a model, field or item of a CrafterCMS content type and then invoking XB initializer.

To initialize XB, you need to invoke the ``initExperienceBuilder`` function. This function receives a single argument which gets passed down to the :ref:`ExperienceBuilder component <ExperienceBuilder>`. See argument details on the ExperienceBuilder component section.
At a minimum, you need to supply the ``isAuthoring`` boolean flag, together with either a ``ContentInstance`` or the ``path`` for the main model to initialize XB with.
For example, a simple application that uses the UMD bundle for XB, would look something like this:

.. code-block:: html
    :force:

    <script defer src="/studio/static-assets/scripts/craftercms-xb.umd.js"></script>
    <script>
      // Run when XB script has been loaded, as it is deferred.
      document.addEventListener('craftercms.xb:loaded', () => {
        // Determine if we're on authoring using `fetchIsAuthoring` utility. Remove/replace if you determine whether it is authoring/delivery through some other mechanism.
        window.craftercms.xb.fetchIsAuthoring().then((isAuthoring) => {
          // If we're in authoring, initialize XB
          isAuthoring && window.craftercms.xb.initExperienceBuilder({ isAuthoring, path: '/site/website/index.xml' });
        });
      });
    </script>

In contrast, in an npm project setup, this might look something like this:

.. code-block:: js

    import { fetchIsAuthoring, initExperienceBuilder } from '@craftercms/experience-builder';
    // Determine if we're on authoring using `fetchIsAuthoring` utility. Remove/replace if you determine whether it is authoring/delivery through some other mechanism.
    fetchIsAuthoring().then((isAuthoring) => {
       // If we're in authoring, initialize XB
       if (isAuthoring) {
          initExperienceBuilder({ isAuthoring, path: '/site/website/index.xml' });
       }
    });

.. _fetchIsAuthoring:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
fetchIsAuthoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This function checks against the specified CrafterCMS server if it is running against an authoring server.
When running in authoring, in-context editing tools should be enabled in the application whilst in
delivery (i.e. "production"), they should not.

The function returns a promise which will resolve as true or false. This value should be fetched early
on your application bootstrap and cached for the rest of the app lifecycle. Depending on the value,
you should then carry on to initialize XB or bypass it's initialization and assume the app is running
in "production", where authoring tools are completely absent.

``fetchIsAuthoring`` internally uses the ``crafterConf`` object from the ``@craftercms/classes`` package.
See `SDK docs <https://github.com/craftercms/js-sdk/tree/develop/packages/classes#crafterconf>`__ for more information.

.. code-block:: js

      import { fetchIsAuthoring, initExperienceBuilder } from '@craftercms/experience-builder';

      // Check if we're in authoring
      fetchIsAuthoring().then((isAuthoring) => {
         // If we're in authoring, initialize XB
         if (isAuthoring) {
            initExperienceBuilder()
         }
      })

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``config``
     - Record<'baseUrl' | 'site', string>
     - undefined
     - You can supply a baseUrl and/or site to make the check. ``fetchIsAuthoring`` uses ``crafterConf``
       (from ``@craftercms/classes`` package) values when not supplied.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
addAuthoringSupport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Add authoring support will import the XB scripts on to your page.

.. _getICEAttributes:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
getICEAttributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use this method to get the set of attributes to place on each element that represents a CrafterCMS
model, field or item. Once you've fetched your content, you'd invoke ``getICEAttributes`` and it will
return all the necessary attributes to inform the system how to make such element editable in XB.

You should first set all the attributes on your markup and afterwards, invoke `initExperienceBuilder <#initexperiencebuilder>`_

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 10 10 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``config``
     - `ICEConfig <https://github.com/craftercms/studio-ui/blob/33b003c49fdde3ea00e1d95ca02d9f1e6869b301/ui/guest/src/index.tsx#L40>`_
     - (Required)
     - You must supply at a minimum the ``model`` and ``isAuthoring``. The ``fieldId`` must be
       supplied when the artifact being rendered is a field. The ``index`` must be specified when
       the artifact being rendered is inside a collection (repeat groups or item selectors).

.. _js-app-initExperienceBuilder:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
initExperienceBuilder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use this method to initialize experience builder once you have printed all the attributes (see
`getICEAttributes <#geticeattributes>`__) on your markup.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 10 10 70
