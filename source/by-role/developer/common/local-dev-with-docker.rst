=============================
Local Development with Docker
=============================

While local development is best done with a CrafterCMS bundle (:ref:`install-craftercms-via-binary-bundles`), sometimes Docker is the path of least resistance. To persist across Docker container restarts, you'll need to have the Authoring project/site repositories in your docker container available in the host filesystem, specially if you want to update the files from your IDE. To support access to your projects via a local IDE, we need to mount the Authoring project repositories directory to a host directory.

   .. note::
       Performance may be slow when using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) and a mounted Authoring project repositories directory to a host directory.

This section describes how to configure CrafterCMS on Docker for local development tools.

Here are the steps:

   .. NOTE::
      This will only work on an Authoring install with no existing data. To clear the current data, run the same command you've been using to start up the environment, but replace the ``up`` part for ``down -v``, e.g.

      .. code-block:: bash

         docker-compose down -v

#. Check the project directory is a shared drive

   Make sure the drive with the directory that will contain the projects is a shared drive by clicking on Docker Desktop ``Settings`` -> ``Resources`` -> ``File Sharing``)

#. Edit the ``docker-compose.yml`` file

   Navigate to the ``authoring`` directory and open the ``docker-compose.yml`` file in an editor and edit the ``crafter_data`` volume like in the highlighted section below (assume C is the shared drive, and replace the ``/host/path/to/projects`` for the actual host path):

   .. code-block:: yaml
       :emphasize-lines: 25-31
       :caption: *authoring/docker-compose.yml*

       ...

       tomcat:
         image: craftercms/authoring_tomcat:latest # craftercms version flag
         depends_on:
           - search
           - deployer
         ports:
           - 8080:8080
         ...

       deployer:
         image: craftercms/deployer:latest # craftercms version flag
         depends_on:
           - search
         ports:
           - 9191:9191
         ...

       volumes:
         search_data:
           name: crafter_authoring_data_search
         search_logs:
           name: crafter_authoring_logs_search
         crafter_data:
           driver: local
           driver_opts:
             o: bind
             type: none
             device: C:/host/path/to/projects
           name: crafter_authoring_data
         crafter_logs:
           name: crafter_authoring_logs
         crafter_temp:
           name: crafter_authoring_temp

#. Start Authoring.

   Go to the Authoring browser URL and create a project/site. In the image below, project ``editorial`` was created using the website editorial blueprint:

   .. image:: /_static/images/developer/docker/docker-install-site-created.webp

#. Access your project files from your host directory

   You should now be able to see the files in your host directory and use any IDE for editing the files in the project.

   Let's take a look at an example of modifying a file in your host directory then verifying that the changes are reflected in your project. In your browser, open the ``Sidebar``, then navigate to ``scripts`` -> ``pages`` then right click on ``home.groovy`` and select ``edit``.

   .. image:: /_static/images/developer/docker/docker-install-script-file-orig.webp
      :alt: Docker Desktop - unedited script file in browser
      :width: 65 %
      :align: center

   |

   We'll now edit the same ``home.groovy`` file from the host directory using any of your favorite IDE. For our example, the files in the project were put in a project in IntelliJ IDEA, and some text was added to the comments

   .. image:: /_static/images/developer/docker/docker-install-script-file-on-host.webp
      :alt: Docker Desktop - Edited script file on host
      :width: 65 %
      :align: center

   |

   After making your edits, remember to commit your changes by using git so Studio is aware of the changes made.

   To commit your changes , head to ``/host/path/to/projects/repos/sites/editorial/sandbox`` and ``git add`` your edited file like this

   .. code-block:: bash

      git add scripts/pages/home.groovy

   |

   And once you are done, commit them with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git commit -m "<the commitâ€™s description>"

   |

   You can also use any Git client. Now, it will be available in your project in the Docker container. Remember that whenever you edit directly in the filesystem instead of through Studio, you need to commit your changes to ensure they are properly reflected.

   Finally, let's check the ``home.groovy`` file from Studio to verify that changes we made from the host are reflected on Studio, by opening the file in Studio again:

   .. image:: /_static/images/developer/docker/docker-install-script-file-edited.webp
      :alt: Docker Desktop - Edited script file from host in Studio
