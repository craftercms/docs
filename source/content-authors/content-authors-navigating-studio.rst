For the dashboard shown above, here are the widgets listed:

    * Items Waiting for Approval
        * Shows all items currently in workflow
        * Viewable only to admins and publishers

    * Approved Scheduled Items
        * Shows all items approved for a specific scheduled deployment date
        * Viewable only to admins and publishers

    * Recently Published
        * Shows all items that have been previously deployed
        * Viewable only to admins and publishers

    * My Recent Activity
        * Shows all items recently modified by the current user
        * Viewable by all users

    * Icon Guide
        * The Icon guide is simply a legend to help authors and content managers with the iconography on the system. While it can be very complex to sum up the state and nature of content in a glance, Crafter Studio attempts to achieve a high level visual summary for each object icons. You will see these icons throughout the application whenever an object is presented to the user. The icon always shows the Current state of the object.
        * Describes the meaning of icons within Crafter Studio
        * Viewable by all users
        * The Icon guide breaks down icons in to their elements.  You have two basic elements which can be combined to form a specific icon: the item type and the worfkflow indicator.

            **Item Types**

            Item types are high level archetypes of content objects within the system.  These types and the iconography associated with them provide a basic classification of the type of object at a glance.

            |workflowPage|:	A page is exactly what you would expect, it's a URI addressable object that represents a web page or resource.

            |workflowComponent|: A component is an object that is generally not URI addressable on the website.  Examples are objects like Banners, Touts, Sidebar content etc. Components are usually re-usable assets that can be assigned and shared across many pages.

            |workflowTaxonomy|: A taxonomy is an object the same as a component used for classifying items.

            Below is a list of all the other item types available:

             - |workflowCss|
             - |workflowFolder|
             - |workflowLevelDescriptor|
             - |workflowTemplateScript|
             - |workflowGroovy|
             - |workflowImage|
             - |workflowJavaScript|
             - |workflowJson|
             - |workflowHTML|
             - |workflowCss|
             - |workflowPlainText|
             - |workflowXML|
             - |workflowFont|
             - |workflowIcon|

            |
            |

            **Workflow States**

            Workflow States help authors and content managers understand at a glance what is going on with the content at a high level.  Is it Live?  Is it work in progress?  Is it currently checked out? In some sort of approval process?

            |workflowNeverPub|:	You will find a * asterisk at the end of a content object's name if the content has never been pushed live. This helps authors quickly identify which objects that are in progress are already live and which ones are entirely new.

            |workflowDisabled|:	You will find that some objects have a strike-through on their name, this means that the object is not deleted but it should not be displayed on the site.  It's essentially a logical delete.  Imagine a scenario where you need to take an object down immediately because of an inaccuracy while you make corrections.  Disable is perfect for this and several other scenarios.

            |workflowInWorkflow|: Any item which carries the blue flag is in some sort of workflow

            Submitted for Delete:	Items which carry the * red X * but are editable and previewable have been submitted for delete

            |workflowDeleted|: Items which carry the * red X * but are not editable and previewable are deleted.  You will only see these items in dashboards which show historical data
 
            |workflowEdited|: Edited means that the item has been edited since it was made live. Items move to edited as soon as they are created or when they are edited.

            |workflowLocked|: A locked item is currently in the process of being edited by another author.

            |workflowProcessing|: Item is currently being handled by the system

            |workflowScheduled|: Item has a launch schedule associated with it

            **Publishing Status/Target**

            |publishStaging|: Item has been published to the ``staging`` publishing target

            |publishLive|: Item has been published to the ``live`` publishing target

    |
    |

    **Selecting a dashboard item**

        Dashboard items have the ability to be selected.  Selecting an item allows the user to interact with the selected items via the context navigation

        Items in the dashboard has a icons which shows the type and current workflow status of the item

        Clicking on ``Options`` (the three dots next to the item) shows the type and current workflow status of the item, plus all oprions available e.g. ``Edit``, ``Publish``, etc.
