Working with Assets
===================

Assets are binary files, typically images, videos, etc. which can be uploaded directly by Authors from the sidebar navigation tree to CrafterCMS.

.. note::
	.. include:: /includes/valid-file-names.rst

Adding Assets
-------------
To upload a file (images, videos, etc.), in the Sidebar click on **Static Assets**, then click again on the folder named **static-assets**.  This will show you a list of folders containing assets already uploaded, such as images, fonts, etc.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Creating a folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the file you are uploading does not belong in any of the existing folders, you can just create another folder to upload your file to by doing the following:

Click on the three dots next to the folder **static-assets**, then select **New Folder**

Enter a name for the new folder then click on the **Create** button.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To add a file, from the folder **static-assets**, navigate to the folder you want to add the files to, then click on the three dots next to the folder and select **Upload**

Adding a file from one of the upload controls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A file may also be added via one of the upload controls and data source in a content form, such as the ``Image`` control together with the ``Image uploaded from desktop`` data source.

To upload using one of the controls, while editing a content form, click on the button for adding/replacing an asset which would give you an option to use an existing asset or to upload an asset.
