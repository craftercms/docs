==================
Working with Pages
==================

This section describes how content authors can create and use pages to manage content.
Templates are used for page layouts in CrafterCMS.  A developer usually creates the templates that authors can then use to manage content.

-------------
Adding a Page
-------------
To add a page, in the Sidebar panel, then click on **Pages**.  Navigate to the level and location within the path navigation tree where you want to create the content, then click on the three dots next to the parent page and select *New Content*

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-add-new-content.webp
    :width: 50 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Content Author - Add New Page Content

You will then be prompted to choose a content type.  Select a starter page template from the list shown. If you need a template that's not available or want to modify the template, ask a developer to add/modify the template that you want.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-add-choose-content.webp
    :width: 75 %    
    :align: center
    :alt: Content Author - Add New Page Choose Content

A form will open containing the template selected. You can now start adding content.  Required fields have a red 'x' after the field label.  The number of required fields within each section is displayed in the Section bar for that section.

When data is entered into a field, the red 'x' will change to a green checkmark and the section bar will update with the new status.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-add-template-open.webp
    :width: 75 %    
    :align: center
    :alt: Content Author - Add New Page Open Template

An action bar is available at the bottom of the screen that cannot be scrolled away. This bar allows users to Save as Draft, Save & Minimize, Save & Preview, Save & Close or Cancel.

    * **Save as Draft** will save the content entered on the form and leave the New Page/Editing dialog open
    * **Save & Minimize** will save the content entered on the form, then minimize the form
    * **Save & Preview** will save the content entered on the form then close the form and load the preview screen with the newly saved data
    * **Save & Close** will save the content then close the form.
    * **Cancel** will close the form without making any changes and will warn users if there are unsaved changes.

To minimize the form, click on the ``-`` at the top of the Content Form right next to the ``x``.  When a form is minimized, it will appear at the bottom right of the screen with an arrow pointing up next to it.  To maximize the form, simply click on that arrow pointing up.

Editing a Page
--------------
There are multiple ways to edit a page.  
    
    #. In the Sidebar panel click on **Pages**.  Navigate to the level and location within the path navigation tree where you want to edit the content, then click on the three dots on the right and select **Edit**.  A form containing the page content you want to edit will open.
    
    #. In the Sidebar panel click on **Pages**.  Navigate to the level and location within the path navigation tree where you want to edit the content and click on it to preview the page.  Toggle ``Edit Mode`` to on (switch at the top right corner) to turn on in-context editing and the experience builder panel, if it's not turned on yet.  Move your mouse over to the area you would like the edit.  As you're moving the mouse around the page, notice that the cursor changes to a pencil on editable sections.  Click anywhere editable on the page to start editing.

    #. In the Sidebar panel click on **Pages**.  Navigate to the level and location within the path navigation tree where you want to edit the content and click on it to preview the page.  Click the three dots next to the address url on the toolbar found at the top of your screen. Click on ``Edit``.  A form containing the page content you want to edit will open.

----------
Versioning
----------
CrafterCMS tracks all changes to pages/contents/static assets in your project.

All page changes/versions can be viewed, compared with other versions and reverted to an older version.  There are a couple of ways to view the History of your desired page.  Navigate to the page you want to view the history of from the project navigation tree.

After selecting the page you want, click on ``Options`` (the three dots next to the address url at the top of your browser) then select **History**.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-access-history.webp
    :width: 95 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Content Author - Access Page History

Another way to view the history of a page is by clicking on the three dots next to the page you want on the Sidebar and then selecting **History**

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Version History
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are a number of things that you can do in the Version History dialog.  On the right hand side of the dialog, for each entry/version on the list, there are a number of actions that you can perform on the version you selected, accessible by clicking on the three dots next to it.

Form based editing
------------------

Form controls are the building blocks of forms.  It lets you get content into the system.  

Forms are the means by which content is captured in Crafter Studio. A form generally maps to or represents a type of object in the system for example a certain kind of page - like a section page or a banner or video. Let's look at some common elements of a form and examine some of the controls that we use to get content in to the system.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-form.webp
    :width: 75 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Content Author - Page Form

When a new page is created or a page is edited, the form interface for these functions will open in a new dialog. A user can Expand or Collapse all of the sections on the page using the "Expand All" or "Collapse All" links at the top of the page.  
Clicking the +/- control on the Section Label will toggle the expanded or collapsed state for each section.

The number of required fields within each section is displayed in the Section bar for that section.

An icon in front of the Section Label will display a red 'x' (when required fields are not complete), or a green check mark (when all required fields are complete) to denote status.

Every required field will have a red 'x' icon after it's Field Label.

When data is entered into a field the red 'x' will change to a green check mark and the section bar will update with the new status. An action bar is available at the bottom of the screen that cannot be scrolled away. This bar allows users to Save, Save & Minimize, Save & Preview, Save & Close or Cancel and minimize/maximize the form.

* **Save as Draft** will save the content entered on the form and leave the New Page/Editing dialog open
* **Save & Minimize** will save the content entered on the form, then minimize the form
* **Save & Preview** will save the content entered on the form then close the form and load the preview screen with the newly saved data
* **Save & Close** will save the content then close the form.
* **Cancel** will close the form without making any changes and will warn users if there are unsaved changes.
* To minimize the form, click on the **-** at the top of the Content Form right next to the **x**.

The fields within each section are completely modular and can be applied to any given page as needed. This modularity allows us to craft edit pages for any new screens as they arise without the need for specific UI work on the edit screen.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Editing Controls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are some controls that authors may encounter while editing content:

* Dropdowns - Allows the user to select an item from the list.  When not selecting an item from the dropdown, the selected item is shown on the box.

    :align: center
    :alt: Content Author - Form Control Checkbox

* Group checkboxes - Allows users to select one or more items in a group
* Input boxes - Simple text input control allows users to input text up to the character limit indicated next to the input box.  The character limit specifies both the MAXLENGTH and SIZE attributes for the field.  The character counter will count up as the user types into the field.
* Date/Time pickers - The Date and Time input can allow entry of both Date and Time, only Date or only Time, depending on what was setup.
* Rich text editors - What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor that allows authors to arrange and style content without needing to know HTML.  Below is a more detailed description on working in the RTE.
* Repeating Group - Group of controls (1 or more controls) that can be duplicated multiple times by clicking on **Add Another**.  If there are two or more instances, "Move Up" and "Move Down" links will be available which will move the group up or down in relation to the other group instances.

* Page Order - Allows the user to change the position of the page in the navigation structure.  To change the position of the page, select **Yes**, an **Edit Position** button will appear.  Click on the **Edit Position** button, a form will appear that lets the user drag and drop the position of the page the user is editing, called **Current Page**.  The first time navigation is turned on for the page, the **Current Page** will always default to the top position.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Placing Content Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Drag and drop makes it easy for authors to visually assemble pages. Authors simply choose a component from a pre-defined list of components/widgets, drag them on to the screen, place them where they want (in defined drop zones), and then configure them. Authors may also move components from one zone to another or remove components.

The ``Edit Mode`` switch puts the page in component construction mode.  Regions on the page that are wired to accept components ("drop target") are highlighted.  In the component construction mode, the user may drag an existing component or place a new component to be configured in the drop target.  The user may also drag a component from one region to another.  Crafter Studio administrators can configure what components are available in this panel.

    :alt: Content Author - Page Components

Drag and Drop Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Placing new components

The user may create new components by dragging components from the experience builder panel (**Component** section) out and on to the drop target on the screen.  A new component with default values will then be visible and ready for editing when a new component is dropped on the screen.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-components-new.webp
    :width: 50 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Content Author - Page Components New

* Placing existing components

The user may add existing components into the panel by clicking on **Browse Components**.  A list of existing components will be presented that can be dragged and dropped into the drop target

.. image:: /_static/images/content-author/preview-page-builder-browse-components.webp
    :width: 30 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Content Author - Experience Builder Panel Browse Components

* Moving components around

Components inside the drop targets may be moved around to the desired position.  Simply click, then drag and drop to the desired position in the drop target.

.. image:: /_static/images/content-author/preview-page-components-drag.webp
    :width: 85 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Content Author - Experience Builder Panel Page Drag Component

* Deleting components

To remove a component from the drop target, just drag the feature to the trash bin that appears on the bottom right of the screen when dragging around a component.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Working in the Rich Text Editor(RTE)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The RTE (Rich Text Editor) is intended to provide an in-context editing experience from within a form (rather than a preview) that allows authors to arrange and style content without needing to know HTML.  In an RTE field, the RTE toolbar is at the top, and is always available regardless of how far down you scroll in the RTE field.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/rte-screen.webp
    :width: 75 %    
    :align: center
    :alt: Content Author - RTE Screen


There are a number of tools available from the RTE out of the box for editing your content.  Custom tools may also be added to the RTE, depending on your needs.  Please see the developer section :ref:`rte-configuration` of the docs for more details.

Copying a Page
--------------

To copy a page, in the Sidebar panel, click on the **Pages** folder.  Navigate to the level and location within the project navigation tree where you want to copy content, then click on the three dots next to the page and select **Copy**

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-copy-menu.webp
    :width: 30 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Content Author - Copy Page Menu

In the Sidebar panel, navigate to the level and location within the project navigation tree where you want to paste the copied content, then click on the three dots next to it and select **Paste**

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-paste-menu.webp
    :width: 30 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Content Author - Paste Page Menu

|

Depending on how the page content type has been modeled (dependencies), copying and pasting a page may also create copies of items in the page. These dependencies are setup by the developers when creating the content type.  Generally, when an item on a page is uploaded to the following locations: ``/site/components/item/.*`` or  ``/static-assets/item/.*``, when the page containing those items is copied, a copy of the uploaded items are created.

To learn more about these dependencies and see examples, see :ref:`item-specific-dependencies` or :ref:`copy-dependencies-configuration`.

Deleting a Page
---------------

Users with permission to delete content can delete a page from a project.  To delete a page, in the Sidebar panel,
click on the **Pages** folder.  Navigate to the level and location within the project navigation tree where you
want to delete content, then click on the three dots next to the page and select **Delete**

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-delete-menu.webp
   :width: 40 %

.. _disabling-a-page:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Disabling a Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A page content type can be modeled to disable a page in content delivery via the reserved variable ``disabled``.
This variable indicates an object is “hidden” in live and cannot be retrieved via services like search or the
site item service.

To model a content type that allows disabling a page, do the following:

#. Open the content type you'd like to add ``disabled`` by opening the Sidebar, then clicking on
   ``Project Tools`` -> ``Content Type``, then select the desired page content type
#. Drag a ``Check Box`` control to the ``Page Property`` form section. Set the ``Title`` to something
   descriptive, say ``Disable Page`` and remember that the ``Name/Variable Name`` value needs to be
   set to ``disabled``.  Save your changes.

Let's take a look at an example of a page content type with ``disabled`` and how the page appears in preview and
in delivery.  We will be using a project created using the ``Website Editorial`` blueprint named
``my-editorial`` for this example.

We'll open the content type ``Article`` of the project.  Below is the ``Article`` content type modeled
with ``disabled``, as described above.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-disable-setup.webp
   :width: 90 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Content Type with disabled setup

|

Let's now disable an article in the project, then publish it and see how the project behaves in delivery when
a page has been disabled.

We'll disable the article ``10 Tips to Get a Six Pack``.  First, we'll take a look at how the ``Health``
category page looks like with the article still enabled in Preview by opening the Sidebar, then clicking
on the ``Home`` page then finally click on the ``Health`` category on the left-rail.:

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-enabled.webp
   :width: 60 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Article "10 Tips to Get a Six Pack" enabled

|

Notice above that there are three articles listed in the ``Health`` category page and it contains the
article that we are now going to disable.  To disable the page ``10 Tips to Get a Six Pack``, open the
Sidebar, then navigate to ``/articles/2021/2/``.  Click on the three dots next to the article then select
``Edit``, which will open a form allowing us to edit the article.  Once the form opens, put a checkmark
on the ``Disable Page`` field under the ``Page Properties`` section then save your changes.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-disable-article.webp
   :width: 60 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Disable article "10 Tips to Get a Six Pack"

|

Preview the ``Home`` page and click on the ``Health`` category on the left-rail.  Notice that the article we
disabled is not listed in the preview.  Note too that on the Sidebar, the article we disabled will have
a red circle with a slash on it indicating that the page is disabled.

.. image:: /_static/images/page/page-disabled.webp
   :width: 60 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Content Author - Article "10 Tips to Get a Six Pack" disabled

|

Finally, we'll publish the changes we made to the article and verify that in delivery, the article we
disabled is not available/accessible.  To publish your changes, on the Sidebar, click on the three dots
next to the article we just edited, then select ``Publish``.  A Publish dialog will appear.  Check the
information in the dialog and make changes as required, then click on the ``Publish`` button.

In your browser, go to ``localhost:9080?crafterSite=my-editorial`` to view your project in delivery.  Next,
we'll view the ``Health`` category page and verify that the article ``10 Tips to Get a Six Pack`` is not listed:
