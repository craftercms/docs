Access User Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the authentication and authorization configurations are completed you can use the ``authToken`` object in
templates and scripts to access the current user attributes. The class of the object will change depending of the
authentication provider used, but you can always obtain an instance of |CustomUser| using the ``principal`` property.

  <#if authToken??>
    Hello ${authToken.principal.attributes.firstName}!
  <#else>
    <#-- show login button -->
  </#if>

.. note:: You can find more details about the ``authToken`` variable in :ref:`templating-api` or :ref:`groovy-api`

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Migrating from Crafter Profile
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Prior to version ``3.1.5`` Crafter Profile was the only security provider available, all projects created in previous
versions will continue to work without any changes, however if you need to migrate to a different provider like SAML2
you will need to replace all uses of the ``profile`` and ``authentication`` variables, both have been replaced with
``authToken``.

In templates and scripts you can replace all uses of ``profile`` with ``authToken`` and ``profile.attributes`` with
``authToken.principal.attributes``.

   .. note:: Some advanced uses like custom security filters will need to be updated to integrate with Spring Security


|

   .. important::
      **The variables** ``profile`` **and** ``authentication`` **will be null in most cases and should not be used anymore**


.. |CustomUser| replace:: :javadoc_base_url:`CustomUser <engine/org/craftercms/engine/util/spring/security/CustomUser.html>`
