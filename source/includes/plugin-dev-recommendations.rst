We recommend using `React <https://reactjs.org>`_ and `Material UI <https://mui.com>`_ to develop your
apps and widgets since these will provide the most coherent integration and seamless experience for the
end user provided that CrafterCMS' UI is developed in those technologies. This will also allow you to
leverage all of Studio UI components, utilities and apis. See examples below for sample apps developed
using these technologies.
