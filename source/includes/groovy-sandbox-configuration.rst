When a Groovy script is executed all code is validated against a blacklist of insecure expressions to prevent code that could
compromise the system. When you try to execute a script that contains insecure expressions you will see an error
similar to this:

.. code-block:: none
    :caption: *Error message encountered for scripts containing insecure expressions*

    UnsupportedOperationException: Insecure call staticMethod java.lang.Runtime getRuntime ...

|

It is recommended to keep the default configuration if possible. However, if access to one or more of the blacklisted expressions
is required, it is possible to override the blacklist configuration. Configuration is global and affects all scripts on the server.

.. warning:: When you allow a script to make an insecure call you should make sure it can only be executed with known
             arguments and **never** with unverified user input.
