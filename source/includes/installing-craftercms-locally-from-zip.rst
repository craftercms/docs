Common Issues
-------------
================================================
Something is already running on configure ports.
================================================
Crafter's install is setup to run TOMCAT on port 8080 and the deployer on 9191.  If other servers are running on those ports CrafterCMS will not start properly.

===============
Java on Windows
===============
Often times JAVA_HOME is not properly configured on Windows. Make sure Java is in your PATH system environment variable configuration and that JAVA_HOME is properly defined as a system environment variable as well.
