==================
Your First Website
==================

This section assumes that you have followed the steps in the :ref:`Quick Start Guide <quick_start_guide>` to get CrafterCMS and login. We will be using an out-of-the-box blueprint, called "Website_Editorial" to create your first website.

Let's get started building your first website!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Creating your website from out of the box blueprint Website Editorial
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After logging in, you'll see the Sites screen (Below).  Click on **Create Site**

In the **Create Site** screen, the user is presented with the available blueprints or the option to use a remote Git repository instead of selecting a blueprint from the list.  To see all available blueprints, scroll through the two tabs available, ``Private Blueprints`` which contains default blueprints available out of the box from Crafter Studio including the option use a remote Git repository to create a new site, and ``Public Marketplace``. which contains blueprints submitted to `Crafter's Marketplace <https://github.com/marketplace/crafter-marketplace>`_

We're going to be using the "Website Editorial Blueprint".  Blueprints offer you a starting point for your website. New blueprints can be created and installed into the system.  Click on **Use** for the "Website Editorial Blueprint".

Adding a new article page to the site
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We'll be adding a new article to the site.  To add a new article (or a new page), navigate to the level and location within the site navigation tree in the **Sidebar** where we want to create the new page.  In this case, we are adding an article under **articles** -> **2017** -> **3**.  Right click, then select **New Content**

We'll then select the page template we want.  Since we are adding a new article to the site, we will be selecting the template **Page - Article**

We'll start filling out the form for our new article, "Where to find cherry blossoms in Virginia".  For the **Page URL**, replace spaces with dashes.  You can write the **Internal Name** and **Title** however you like as long as it is 50 characters or less as indicated on the right of the input boxes.  For the **Header** and **Left Rail**, we will be using the default provided by the template.

Updating the Contact Us section in the sidebar

Another thing that we may want to modify from the blueprint, is the left rail.  For this example, we are going to modify the **Contact Us** section in the left rail (contact widget).  To edit items in the left rail, click on the pencil on the top right of your screen to enable in-context editing.  Pencils should appear on sections editable on the page.  Go to the top left of the left rail and click on the pencil there.

    :alt: Your First Website - Add Features through Drag and Drop

We'll start out by adding a feature using the pencil at the top of the features section (In the image above, we will use the pencil captioned "Edit the whole features section").  Click on the pencil at the top of the features section.  A form will open containing the content of the section.  As you can see in the image below, there are currently two features in the section.

In this form, you can add another feature, by clicking on the **Add** button, which will give you a menu to **Create New - Features** or **Browse for Existing - features**

We will add a feature by selecting **Create New - Features** as seen on the image above.  This will open a form, where we will now enter our content.

We will now add another feature, by selecting **Browse for Existing - Features**, after clicking on the **Add** button.  This will bring up a form containing a list of existing features in the blueprint.  Select one, then click on **Add & Close** or, click on the radio button of your selection, then click on **Add Selection**.  This will add your selected existing feature to the features section of the page.

We will again add another feature, this time by opening the **Preview Tools** panel, and then clicking on **Page Components**.  A **Components** panel will open where the **Preview Tools** panel used to be, containing components that you can drag and drop onto the drop zone highlighted on the page.  To click and drag a new feature onto the drop zone, click and drag **Feature**, under the general heading.  This will then open up a form for you to add your new feature content.  To click and drag an existing feature onto the drop zone, click on **Browse Features**.  This will then open up a form containing a list of existing features that you may choose from.  Make your selection, the form with the list will then close and now you can drag and drop your selected existing feature onto the drop zone.

From inside the drop zone, you may also re-arrange the features by clicking and dragging on a feature and placing it in your desired position.  Notice the positioning of the newly added feature and the existing features, which have been re-arranged compared to the previous image.  To delete/remove a feature from the drop zone, just click on the **X** as show in the image below.

Publishing Your New/Edited Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Your site is published after creating the site from the Website_Editorial blueprint.  If you make edits to any of the pages or created new pages, it will need to be published for your site visitors to see the changes.  There are a couple of ways to publish your page edits.  The first thing you need to do is to navigate to the page you want to publish in the Site Navigation Tree (Enabled by clicking on **Sidebar** on the right of the CrafterCMS logo on the upper left hand corner of Studio).  After navigating to the page you want to publish, there are two ways to publish:

- Click on the page you want to publish.  In the context menu, click on **Approve & Publish**
- Right click on the page you want to publish from the Site Navigation Tree, then click on **Approve & Publish**

.. image:: /_static/images/first-site/first-site-publish.jpg

    :alt: Your First Website - Publish Your New Content

You will then be prompted whether you want to publish the page now (**Items should go live now**), or publish the page at a later date and time (**Items go live on a specific date & time**).
