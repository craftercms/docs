  .. note::
     The following is primarily an internal change. It would only affect those developing authoring applications using the functions described below either via ``@craftercms/studio-ui`` npm package or using the craftercms global on an authoring extension.

  New argument ``unflattenedPaths`` added to the bottom of the arguments list of the following functions:

  - ``utils/content/parseContentXML``
  - ``utils/content/parseElementByContentType``

  The argument should be an object that will be populated by the method with ``path: object`` pairs for the unflattened content items whose data is incomplete while processing.
  *Note: This argument is likely to be required in the next versions of the package.*
