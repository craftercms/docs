  - Items are evaluated for permissions based on their paths regardless of where they are listed. The permission
    ``~DASHBOARD~`` is now removed from the list of allowed permissions. The upgrade manager will remove it from your
    project during your install upgrade.

    This new option is set to false by default.
  * `Studio now does a \"Publish All\" request when \"Publish By Path='/'\" request is received <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/5950>`__

* Migrated the Studio UI build to Vite/SWC
* Rollup's XB build to use SWC
* Upgraded target compilation to ES2022, dropping many code transforms for features that are supported by most modern browsers such as nullish coalescing, optional chaining, object spreading and destructuring.
* The ``allowedContentTypes`` ContentTypeField validation changed from being an array to a Record<contentTypeId, { embedded?: true; shared?: true; sharedExisting?: true; }>
* Remove legacy ``browseCMIS`` dialog and ``openCMISBrowse`` function from common-api.
* Remove ``CMIS-repo``, ``CMIS-upload``, ``img-cmis-repo``, ``img-CMIS-upload``, ``video-cmis-repo`` and ``video-CMIS-upload`` datasources.
* ``ICEConfig`` TypeScript ``interface`` changed to be ``type``. It now accepts either the (model) or (modelId & path).
* The ``acecode`` TinyMCE plugin (for code-highlighted Rich Text Editor code editing), renders the code exactly as Tiny provides without decoding entities.
