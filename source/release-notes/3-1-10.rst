Crafter CMS 3.1.10
------------------

^^^^^^^
Updates
^^^^^^^

* Added a new environment variable for the backup folder location |br|
  *See* :ref:`backup-and-recovery` *for more information*

* Elasticsearch improvements |br|

  * Disabled date detection in Elasticsearch |br|
    Elasticsearch by default will try to convert fields into dates if the value matches a valid pattern, this could cause conflicts during indexing. See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/dynamic-field-mapping.html#date-detection for more information.

    Date detection is now disabled for all indexes by default.

  * Added support for custom index settings such as total fields limit and depth |br|
    For more information on available index settings, see  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules.html#index-modules-settings.

  * Reindex is now skipped when an Elasticsearch processor is not found.

  * Supported index settings are now copied during reindex.

  The ES index settings will be automatically updated when upgrading to Crafter CMS 3.1.10.  The automatic update is triggered when upgrading to 3.1.10 because of an update to support custom index settings and update to disable date detection as listed above.

* Added content-length header for all responses |br|
  The content-length header is sent for all responses by default.  If you need to disable sending the content-length header for all responses, just set ``crafter.engine.header.etag.enable`` to false
