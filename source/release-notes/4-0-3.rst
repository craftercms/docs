CrafterCMS 4.0.3
----------------

*Released March 24, 2023*

This release includes fixes for issues with the release version 4.0.2

^^^^^^^^^^^^
New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Crafter Studio now uses `zxcvbn <https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn>`__ for password strength management |br|
  See `here <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/5816>`__ for more information

  For more information on configuring the password requirements, see :ref:`crafter-studio-configure-password-requirements`

* Added support for adding headers to responses when there are matched configuration patterns in
  the Engine Project Configuration file |br|

  Crafter Engine now supports configuring ``Cache-Control`` headers via the :ref:`engine-project-configuration` file,
  using the ``headerMappings`` property.  By default, it will follow the cache policies configured, where before, it
  was set to ``no-cache``.

  If you're using a reverse-proxy or a CDN, no changes are required since caching is done by the reverse-proxy/CDN.

  See :ref:`engine-project-configuration` for more information on configuring response headers
