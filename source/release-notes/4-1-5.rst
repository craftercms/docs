  - Fixed issue where the item selector items to which the user doesn't have edit permissions, display the edit button. Clicking the edit button and trying to save an edit crashes the form leaving it in an unusable.
  - Fixed issue with adding a tree navigator with the path of the folder of a page shows an item which clicking it doesn't take the user to preview as expected and clicking to open the item menu shows a skeletonised item menu that never resolves.
  - Fixed issue where the TreeNavigator UI doesn't handle error in the service response and displays a spinner that doesn't go away.
