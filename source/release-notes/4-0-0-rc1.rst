New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* New Studio UI |br|

  - New React-based UI |br|
  - New configuration mechanics of the UI that allow plugins to wire to almost every aspect of the experience. This opens the door for having different authoring experiences per site. |br|
  - New In-Context Editing system, Experience Builder (XB): |br|

    - Edit content in-place |br|
    - Drag and drop components, assets to add/remove or rearrange your site (supports sites built with FreeMarker, React and can easily be extended to support Vue, Angular and other UI frameworks) |br|
    - See :ref:`experience-builder` for more information |br|

* Plugins! |br|

  - New plugin system allowing developers to build plugins for a site (headless/templated) that provide:

    - Authoring side extensions allowing content authors new tools to build the desired experience. This includes extending Crafter Studio’s functionality with server-side code, UI widgets, third-party integration, pre-baked content model items and more. Learn all about it :ref:`here <studio-plugins>`
    - Delivery-side extensions that provide end-user widgets, server-side code, integration with third-party providers and more. Learn about it :ref:`here <create-a-site-plugin>`
    - Host plugins are still supported, see :ref:`here <plugin-host-page-examples>`

    - Read the guide to building your own plugins  :ref:`here <how-do-i-make-my-own-site-plugin>`

* Switched Crafter Studio’s authentication system to JWT |br|

  - It’s now much easier to automate work with Crafter Studio APIs by issuing secure tokens for your automation jobs, see :ref:`working-with-crafter-studios-api` |br|
  - Remember to replace default values for all the variables used to control the access tokens (JWT) used for Studio’s API.  See :ref:`here <securing-your-crafter-cms-install>` for more information on default values used for JWT |br|

* Site Policy

  - File name patterns (permissioning and automatic renaming of files)
  - File mime-type
  - File size

  See :ref:`here <site-policy-configuration>` for more information on the Site Policy configuration

* New Crafter CLI |br|
