  - New configuration mechanics of the UI that allow plugins to wire to almost every aspect of the experience. This opens the door for having different authoring experiences per site. |br|

* **Plugins!** |br|

  - New plugin system allowing developers to build plugins for a site (headless/templated) that provide:

    - Authoring side extensions allowing content authors new tools to build the desired experience. This includes extending Crafter Studio’s functionality with server-side code, UI widgets, third-party integration, pre-baked content model items and more. Learn all about it :ref:`here <site-plugin>`

* **Switched Crafter Studio’s authentication system to JWT** |br|

  - It’s now much easier to automate work with Crafter Studio APIs by issuing secure tokens for your automation jobs, see :ref:`working-with-crafter-studios-api` |br|
  - Remember to replace default values for all the variables used to control the access tokens (JWT) used for Studio’s API.  See :ref:`here <securing-your-crafter-cms-install>` for more information on default values used for JWT |br|

* **Site Content Rules and Policy** |br|

  - File size

  See :ref:`here <site-policy-configuration>` for more information on the Site Policy configuration
