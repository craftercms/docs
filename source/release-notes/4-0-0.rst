    - Authoring side extensions allowing content authors new tools to build the desired experience.
      This includes extending Crafter Studio’s functionality with server-side code, UI widgets,
      third-party integration, pre-baked content model items and more. Learn all about it

  - It’s now much easier to automate work with Crafter Studio APIs by issuing secure tokens for
    your automation jobs, see :ref:`working-with-crafter-studios-api` |br|
  - Remember to replace default values for all the variables used to control the
    access tokens (JWT) used for Studio’s API.  See :ref:`here <securing-your-crafter-cms-install>`
    for more information on default values used for JWT |br|

  Added a project-wide policy configuration that lets site administrators control:

  - File mime-type
  - File size

  See :ref:`here <project-policy-configuration>` for more information on the Project Policy configuration

* **New Crafter CLI** |br|

  The CrafterCMS Command Line Interface (CLI) for DevContentOps, allows you to authenticate with
  CrafterCMS and exercise its APIs from a terminal or automation tools. |br|
  See :ref:`here <devcontentops-toolkit>` for more information on the Crafter CLI

* **Better locale support** |br|

  CrafterCMS allows configuring a locale to be used for displaying dates and times in the Studio UI or,
  it can also be configured to respect the user's locale settings |br|
