  For existing sites the indexes need to be recreated (re-indexing will not fix it if the fields have already been mapped) |br|

  To recreate the indexes in a non-production environment, simply delete the indexes, trigger a normal reindex, and a new one will be created.  To trigger a normal reindex,  you can follow the process :ref:`here <reindexing-content>`, starting in Step 2: Invoke the reprocessing.

  For instructions on recreating the indexes in a production environment, follow the steps :ref:`here <reindexing-content-in-prod>`
  see :ref:`reindexing-content`
