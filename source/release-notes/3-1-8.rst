----------------
CrafterCMS 3.1.8
----------------

*Released July 1, 2020*

^^^^^^^^^^^^
New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Added a new processor ``s3DeploymentEventsProcessor`` that uploads the deployment-events.properties of a site for S3 serverless deployer |br|
  *See* :ref:`deployer-s3-deployment-events-processor` *for more information.*

* Added a new processor, ``gitUpdateCommitIdProcessor``,  that only updates the latest commit id |br|
  *See* :ref:`deployer-git-update-commit-id-processor` *for more information.*

* Added a new property ``updateCommitStore`` for the ``gitDiffProcessor`` that indicates whether or not to update the processed commit |br|
  *See* :ref:`deployer-git-diff-processor` *for more information.*

* Added a new property ``failDeploymentOnFailure`` for all processors that enables failing the deployment when there's a processor failure
  *See* :ref:`crafter-deployer-processors-guide` *for more information.*

* Added support for automatically updating ES index settings |br|
  Whenever the Elasticsearch index settings are updated, for example, a new field has been added for a release, the ES index settings will be automatically updated by the CrafterCMS upgrade manager.  The updated index containing the new settings will be named the current index version name incremented by 1, e.g. let's say the current index is ``mysite-authoring_v1``, after the upgrade, the new index will now be ``mysite-authoring_v2``

  The ES index settings will be automatically updated when upgrading to CrafterCMS 3.1.8 for users upgrading from CrafterCMS 3.1.6 and earlier, and also for users upgrading from CrafterCMS 3.1.7 where a manual update of the ES index settings has not been performed.  The automatic update is triggered when upgrading to 3.1.8 as mentioned above because of an update in the ES index settings (`input fields tokenize in repeating groups <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/4118>`__) in CrafterCMS 3.1.7.

* Elasticsearch improvements |br|
  The Elasticsearch client connection timeout, socket timeout and number of threads to use are now configurable for Studio, Engine and Deployer

  * In Studio, go to ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/``, then edit the :ref:`studio-config-override.yaml <studio-configuration-files>` file and update the following properties to the desired values

     .. code-block:: properties
       :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml*

       # The connection timeout in milliseconds, if set to -1 the default will be used
       studio.search.timeout.connect: -1
       # The socket timeout in milliseconds, if set to -1 the default will be used
       studio.search.timeout.socket: -1
       # The number of threads to use, if set to -1 the default will be used
       studio.search.threads: -1

     |

  * In Engine, go to ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension``, then edit the :ref:`server-config.properties <engine-configuration-files>` and update the following properties to the desired values:

     .. code-block:: properties
       :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*

	   # The connection timeout in milliseconds, if set to -1 the default will be used
       crafter.engine.elasticsearch.timeout.connect=-1
       # The socket timeout in milliseconds, if set to -1 the default will be used
       crafter.engine.elasticsearch.timeout.socket=-1
       # The number of threads to use, if set to -1 the default will be used
       crafter.engine.elasticsearch.threads=-1

     |

  * In Deployer, edit ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/crafter-deployer/config/base-target.yaml`` and update the following to the desired values:

     .. code-block:: yaml
       :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/crafter-deployer/config/base-target.yaml*

       timeout:
         # The connection timeout in milliseconds, if set to -1 the default will be used
         connect: -1
         # The socket timeout in milliseconds, if set to -1 the default will be used
         socket: -1
