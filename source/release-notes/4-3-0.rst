    things to consider before upgrading

^^^^^^^^^^^^
Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `Added support for site selection via headers in Preview <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/7676>`__ |br|

* `Improved extension compatibility versioning <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/7689>`__ |br|
  The ``crafterCmsVersions`` field in your :ref:`plugin <plugin-descriptor-file>` or :ref:`blueprint <blueprint-descriptor-file>`
  descriptor file now uses the short version, using the major and minor numbers, e.g. ``4.3``.

  Note that use of the full CrafterCMS version with the major, minor, and patch numbers is still supported for backward
  compatibility. Remember to maintain the same version format used (either the short version or the full version) and
  not mix them in a plugin version in your descriptor file.

* `Added support for allowing unauthorized OPTIONS requests to preview <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/7699>`__ |br|
  When :ref:`CORS <engine-cors>` is enabled and the CORS request is preflight, preview token validation is skipped.

* `Improved messaging for folder renames and folder cuts <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/7767>`__ |br|
  A message will now be displayed when renaming a folder or cutting a folder to inform users that the action may break
  references to items in the folder being renamed/cut.

* Publishing improvements |br|

  - `The Publish on Demand  widget now uses permissions to determine feature availability <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/7768>`__ |br|
    The permissions ``publish`` and ``publish_by_commits`` are now used to determine feature availability in the Publish
    on Demand widget. Users with the ``publish`` permission gets the ``Publish All`` and ``Publish by Path`` features and
    users with the ``publish_by_commits`` gets the ``Publish by Commit Id`` feature in the widget.

  - `Improved flow for On Demand Publishing <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/7769>`__ |br|
    When performing a ``Publish All``, the user will now be prompted to confirm the action.
