Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `Added support for site selection via headers in Preview <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/7676>`__ |br|

* `Improved extension compatibility versioning <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/7689>`__ |br|
  The ``crafterCmsVersions`` field in your :ref:`plugin <plugin-descriptor-file>` or :ref:`blueprint <blueprint-descriptor-file>`
  descriptor file now uses the short version, using the major and minor numbers, e.g. ``4.2``.

  Note that use of the full CrafterCMS version with the major, minor, and patch numbers is still supported for backward
  compatibility. Remember to maintain the same version format used (either the short version or the full version) and
  not mix them in a plugin version in your descriptor file.

* `Added support for allowing unauthorized OPTIONS requests to preview <https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/issues/7699>`__ |br|
  When :ref:`CORS <engine-cors>` is enabled, preview token validation is skipped for preflight OPTIONS requests.
