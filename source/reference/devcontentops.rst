===================================
DevContentOps Toolkit (Crafter CLI)
===================================

CrafterCMS provides a DevContentOps Toolkit to support :ref:`DevContentOps <devcontentops>` processes in CrafterCMS. The DevContentOps Toolkit contains the CrafterCMS Command Line Interface (CLI), that allows you to authenticate with CrafterCMS and exercise its APIs via a Unix or Windows command line interface.

To run the command line tool (CrafterCMS Command line Interface (CLI) for DevContentOps processes), in your terminal program, navigate to the ``bin`` folder  ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/cli/bin/``. There you will find two versions of the tool:

* **crafter-cli:** - for users on a Linux/macOS operating system
* **crafter-cli.bat** - for users on a Windows operating system

.. _crafter-cli-add-environment:

When using the **crafter-cli**, we first need to setup the connection to CrafterCMS before we can use the other available commands. To setup the connection, run the ``add-environment`` command,  provide a name, the url for a CrafterCMS authoring server and the authentication information.

For the example below, we'll use ``local`` for the name, ``http://localhost:8080`` for the url, and your access token for the authentication. See :ref:`here <access-tokens>` for the steps on how to create a token. Leave the token blank, you will be prompted for the token after issuing the ``add-environment`` command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  ./crafter-cli add-environment -e local -u http://localhost:8080 --token
      Enter value for --token (The access token for authentication):
      Environment added

   |

After setting up the connection to CrafterCMS, you may now create sites or sync a remote repository from the command line, etc:

Here's an example  of creating a site:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  ./crafter-cli create-site -e local -s myeditorial --blueprint org.craftercms.blueprint.editorial
      OK

   |

Here's an example of adding a remote to a site:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  ./crafter-cli add-remote -e local -s editorial -n origin -u http://github.com/john.doe/editorial.git
      Created

   |

Here's an example of syncing to a remote repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

       ➜  ./crafter-cli sync-to -e local -s editorial -n origin -b site-updates
       OK

   |


To view the available commands, type in ``./crafter-cli -h``

   .. code-block:: bash

      ➜  ./crafter-cli -help
      Usage: crafter-cli [-hV] [COMMAND]
