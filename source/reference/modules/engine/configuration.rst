^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Server-based Delivery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this section, we will be working in the delivery environment of CrafterCMS and describing how to setup your project for a delivery environment.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Setup Crafter Deployer Target
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
CrafterCMS out of the box has a script to help you create your deployer target for the delivery environment.

In the ``bin`` folder in your CrafterCMS delivery environment, we will use the script ``init-site.sh`` to help us create the deployer target.

From your command line, navigate to your ``{Crafter-CMS-delivery-environment-directory}/bin/`` , and execute the init-site script. The following output of ``init-site.sh -h``
explains how to use the script:

  .. code-block:: bash
    :force:

    usage: init-site [options] [site] [repo-path]
     -a,--notification-addresses <addresses>   A comma-separated list of email
                                               addresses that should receive
                                               deployment notifications
     -b,--branch <branch>                      The name of the branch to clone
                                               (live by default)
     -f,--passphrase <passphrase>              The passphrase of the private
                                               key (when the key is passphrase
                                               protected)
     -h,--help                                 Show usage information
     -k,--private-key <path>                   The path to the private key, when
                                               using private-key authentication
                                               through SSH to the remote Git repo
     -p,--password <password>                  The password for the remote Git
                                               repo, when using basic
                                               authentication
     -u,--username <username>                  The username for the remote Git
                                               repo, when using basic
                                               authentication
     --addresses <>                            A comma-separated list of email
                                               addresses that should receive deployment notifications

    EXAMPLES:
     Init a site from the default repo path (../../crafter-authoring/data/repos/sites/{sitename}/published)
         init-site mysite
     Init a site from a specific local repo path
         init-site mysite /opt/crafter/authoring/data/repos/sites/mysite/published
     Init a site from a specific local repo path, cloning a specific branch of the repo
         init-site -b master mysite /opt/crafter/authoring/data/repos/sites/mysite/published
     Init a site that is in a remote HTTPS repo with username/password authentication
         init-site -u jdoe -p jdoe1234 mysite https://github.com/jdoe/mysite.git
     Init a site that is in a remote SSH repo with public/private key authentication (specific private key path
     with no passphrase)
         init-site -k ~/.ssh/jdoe_key mysite ssh://myserver/opt/crater/sites/mysite
     Init a site that is in a remote SSH repo with public/private key authentication (specific private key path
     with passphrase)
         init-site -k ~/.ssh/jdoe_key -f jdoe123 mysite ssh://myserver/opt/crater/sites/mysite

.. include:: /includes/ssh-private-key.rst

We recommend using Secure Shell (SSH) with your project's published repo Git URL and for authentication, to use either username/password authentication or public/private key
authentication.

The SSH Git URL format is: ``ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo/`` where sections between **[]** are optional.

Example #1: ``ssh://server1.example.com/path/to/repo``

Example #2: ``ssh://jdoe@server2.example.com:63022/path/to/repo``

   .. note::
      .. include:: /includes/setup-ssh-keys.rst

If you are just working on another directory on disk for your delivery, you can just use the filesystem. When your repository is local, make sure to use the absolute path.
Here is an example project's published repo Git url when using a local repository:

  .. code-block:: bash

      /opt/crafter/authoring/data/repos/sites/my-project/published

.. note::
  * When using ``ssh``, you might see in the logs ``com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: UnknownHostKey`` errors. These errors are common in Ubuntu, and are caused by known host keys being stored in non-RSA format. Please follow the instructions in :ref:`crafter-studio-debugging-deployer-issues` under ``SSH Unknown Host`` to resolve them.

  * ``Git`` needs to be installed in authoring when using SSH to connect the delivery to the authoring.

    If you see the following error in the delivery Deployer: `Caused by: java.io.IOException: bash: git-upload-pack: command not found` you'll need to add the location of git (usually **/usr/bin**) to your non-login shell startup file (e.g. **~/.bashrc**).

    To get the location of Git, run the following command: ``which git-upload-pack``
  * You can limit SSH access by using Git Shell, see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-shell for more information.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Viewing your Site for Testing
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
To test viewing your project, open a browser and type in the URL of your project.

If you have multiple projects setup, to view a certain project, in your browser, enter the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    {Server URL}?crafterSite={siteName}

Here we have an example of a delivery setup in another directory on disk (local), where there are two projects, ``my-awesome-editorial`` and ``hello-world``

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Serverless Delivery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CrafterCMS can be configured to serve sites directly from AWS services, following this guide you will:

- Create a AWS OpenSearch domain (optional)
- Configure a Crafter Studio in an authoring environment to call the Crafter Deployer to create an AWS CloudFormation
  with a CloudFront and S3 bucket for each site
- Configure a Crafter Engine in a delivery environment to read files from the S3 bucket and query to AWS OpenSearch (optional)

"""""""""""""
Prerequisites
"""""""""""""
- An AWS account
- A CrafterCMS authoring environment
- A CrafterCMS delivery environment

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Step 1: Create an OpenSearch Domain for Delivery (optional)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Since serverless delivery requires a single OpenSearch endpoint readable by all Engine instances, we recommend you
create an AWS OpenSearch domain for delivery. If you don't want to use an AWS OpenSearch domain then you should
create and maintain your own OpenSearch cluster.

   .. important:: Authoring can also use an OpenSearch domain, but be aware that in a clustered authoring environment
                  each authoring instance requires a separate OpenSearch instance. If you try to use the same OpenSearch domain
                  then you will have multiple preview deployers writing to the same index.

To create an AWS OpenSearch domain please do the following:

#. In the top navigation bar of your AWS console, click the ``Analytics`` dropdown menu, and search for
   ``Amazon OpenSearch Service``.
#. Click on ``Create domain``.
#. Select ``Deployment Type`` and on the OpenSearch version, pick the closest to ``v2.8.0``.

   .. TODO Fix the image, hide for now
      .. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/serverless/es-deployment-type.webp
          :alt: Serverless Site - OpenSearch Deployment Type
          :align: center

      |

#. On the next screen, enter the domain name. Leave the defaults on the rest of the settings or change as needed per
   your environment requirements, then click on ``Next``.
#. On ``Network Configuration``, we recommend you pick the VPC where your delivery nodes reside. If they're not running
   on an Amazon VPC, then pick ``Public Access``.

   .. TODO Fix the image, hide for now
      .. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/serverless/es-network-access.webp
          :alt: Serverless Site - OpenSearch Network Access
          :align: center

      |

#. Select the ``Access Policy`` that fits your Crafter environment, and click on ``Next`` (if on the same VPC as
   delivery, we recommend ``Do not require signing request with IAM credential``).

   .. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/serverless/es-access-policy.webp
      :alt: Serverless Site - OpenSearch Access Policy
      :align: center

   |

#. Review the settings and click on ``Confirm``.
#. Wait for a few minutes until the domain is ready. Copy the ``Endpoint``. You'll need this URL later to configure
   the Deployer and Delivery Engine which will need access to the OpenSearch.

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Step 2: Configure the Delivery for Serverless Mode
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
#. Edit the services override file to enable the Serverless S3 mode
   (``DELIVERY_INSTALL_DIR/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/services-context.xml``):

   .. code-block:: xml

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

        <import resource="classpath*:crafter/engine/mode/multi-tenant/simple/services-context.xml" />
        <!-- S3 Serverless Mode -->
        <import resource="classpath*:crafter/engine/mode/serverless/s3/services-context.xml" />

      </beans>

   |

#. Edit the properties override file to point Engine to consume the site content from S3
   (``DELIVERY_INSTALL_DIR/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties``). The
   properties you need to update are the following:

   - ``crafter.engine.site.default.rootFolder.path``
   - ``crafter.engine.s3.region``
   - ``crafter.engine.s3.accessKey``
   - ``crafter.engine.s3.secretKey``

   An example of how the :ref:`server-config.properties <engine-configuration-files>` would look with configuration to read from an S3 bucket per site
   (which is the most common use case), is the following (values in ``X`` are not displayed since they're sensitive):

   .. code-block:: properties
      :caption: *DELIVERY_INSTALL_DIR/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*
      :force:

      # Content root folder when using S3 store. Format is s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/<SITES_ROOT>/{siteName}
      crafter.engine.site.default.rootFolder.path=s3://serverless-test-site-{siteName}/{siteName}
      ...

      # S3 Serverless properties
      # S3 region
      crafter.engine.s3.region=us-east-1
      # AWS access key
      crafter.engine.s3.accessKey=XXXXXXXXXX
      # AWS secret key
      crafter.engine.s3.secretKey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

   |

   As you can see, the bucket name portion of the root folder S3 URL contains a prefix and then the site name. This
   prefix is mentioned also as a "namespace" later on in the Studio serverless configuration.

   .. important:: You can also provide the AWS region, access key and secret key without having to edit the config file
                  properties. Please see
                  `Set up AWS Credentials and Region for Development <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html>`_.

#. We recommend that the AWS credentials configured belong to a user with just the following permission policy (all
   strings like ``$VAR`` are placeholders and need to be replaced):

   .. code-block:: json
      :caption: aws-serverless-engine-policy.json
      :linenos:

      {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                  "Resource": "*"
              },
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "s3:ListBucket",
                      "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                      "s3:GetObject"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET_NAME_PREFIX-*"
              }
          ]
      }

   |

#. Edit the ``SEARCH_URL`` in ``DELIVERY_INSTALL_DIR/bin/crafter-setenv.sh`` to point to the OpenSearch endpoint you
   created in the previous step:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export SEARCH_URL=https://vpc-serverless-test-jpwyav2k43bb4xebdrzldjncbq.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com

   |

#. Make sure that the you have an application load balancer (ALB) fronting the Delivery Engine instances and that it's
   accessible by AWS CloudFront.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Step 3: Configure Authoring for Serverless Deployment
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Instead of having one Crafter Deployer per node in delivery, for serverless you just need a single Deployer uploading
files to S3. The authoring preview deployer can also be used for serverless deployment, when there's only one
authoring node. When there's multiple authoring nodes (a cluster), then you'll need to have a separate deployer pulling
from a load balanced SSH/HTTPS URL fronting the Studio Git repos.

In both cases you still need to configure Studio to call the Deployer to create the serverless targets on site creation.
You can find this configuration under ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml``. The properties are well documented in the file so they won't be explained here, but there are still some important things to
notice:

- You need to add the URL of the OpenSearch domain created in a previous step under
  ``studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params.search_url``:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params:
      # The delivery search endpoint (optional is authoring is using the same one, specified in the SEARCH_URL env variable)
      search_url: https://vpc-serverless-test-jpwyav2k43bb4xebdrzldjncbq.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com

  |

- When using the ``aws-cloudformed-s3`` target template (the default one), the Deployer creates first an AWS
  CloudFormation stack with an S3 bucket where the site content will be uploaded and a CloudFront that will serve
  ``/static-assets`` directly and will redirect any other requests to the Delivery Engine LB (which you specify in
  ``studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params.aws.cloudformation.deliveryLBDomainName``).
- The ``aws.cloudformation.namespace`` is basically the prefix of the S3 bucket mentioned in the previous step. This
  prefix will be part of the name of most of the AWS resources created by the serverless deployer.
- You need to specify proper AWS credentials for creating the CloudFormation stack and uploading files to S3, which can
  be done in the following ways:

  - As environment variables or under the default AWS credentials path, like explained in
    `Set up AWS Credentials and Region for Development <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html>`_.
  - In the ``aws.default_access_key`` and ``aws.default_secret_key`` properties under
    ``studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params``:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params:
         aws:
           # AWS access key (optional if specified through default AWS chain)
           default_access_key: XXXXXXXXXX
           # AWS secret key (optional if specified through default AWS chain)
           default_secret_key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

    |

  - In ``aws.cloudformation.access_key`` and ``aws.cloudformation.secret_key`` properties under
    ``studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params``, when specific CloudFormation credentials are needed:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params:
         aws:
           ...
           cloudformation:
             # AWS access key (optional if aws.accessKey is specified)
             access_key: XXXXXXXXXX
             # AWS secret key (optional if aws.secretKey is specified)
             secret_key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

    |

- We recommend that the AWS credentials configured belong to a user with just the following permission policy (all
  strings like ``$VAR`` are placeholders and need to be replaced):

  .. code-block:: json
     :caption: aws-serverless-deployer-policy.json

             }
         ]
     }

- By default, the CloudFront created by Deployer will have a ``*.cloudfront.net`` domain name. To have CloudFront use
  additional domain name(s) please specify the AWS ARN of the domain SSL certificate (``cloudfrontCertificateArn``) and
  the alternate domain name(s) (``alternateCloudFrontDomainNames``):

  .. code-block:: yaml

     studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params:
       aws:
         cloudformation:
           ...
           # The SSL certificate ARN the CloudFront CDN should use (optional when target template is aws-cloudformed-s3)
           cloudfrontCertificateArn: arn:aws:acm:...
           # The alternate domains names (besides *.cloudfront.net) for the CloudFront CDN (optional when target template is aws-cloudformed-s3)
           alternateCloudFrontDomainNames: myawesomesite.com,www.myawesomesite.com

An example of serverless deployment configuration where there's a single authoring instance and no specific domain
name requirements is the following:

Step 4: Create the Site in the Authoring Environment
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
#. Login to the Crafter Studio in the authoring environment from your browser.
#. Click the ``Create Site`` button
#. Choose the ``Editorial`` blueprint, enter the ``Site Id`` (e.g. ``editorial``), and then review and create.
#. Go to your AWS console in your browser and on the ``Services`` dropdown search for CloudFormation. You should then
   see  the CloudFormation for the site you just created with the status ``CREATE_IN_PROGRESS``. After several minutes,
   the status should change to ``CREATE_COMPLETE``, which tells the Crafter Deployer that it is able to start
   uploading files to S3.

.. _engine-configuration-files:

-------------------
Configuration Files
-------------------
Crafter Engine can be configured at the project/site level or at the instance level.

.. _engine-site-configuration-files:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Project-level/Site-level Configuration Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Crafter Engine provides a flexible configuration system that allows site administrators to change
the behavior of the project without the need to modify any code. Some properties are used by Crafter
Engine itself, but developers can also add any custom property they need for their code.

The main configuration files for a project/site can be edited within Crafter Studio's Project Tools > Configuration UI or via Git. These files are:

.. list-table:: Engine Project Configuration Files
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Configuration File
      - Description
    * - Engine Project Configuration (``config/engine/site-config.xml``)
      - Contains project properties used by Crafter Engine
    * - Engine Project Application Context (``config/engine/application-context.xml``)
      - Contains bean definitions for the site context associated with the Webapp
    * - URL Rewrite Configuration (XML Style) (``config/engine/urlrewrite.xml``)
      - Contains URL rewrite rules
    * - Proxy Config (``config/engine/proxy-config.xml``)
      - Configures the proxy servers for the Preview server (Crafter Engine in Preview Mode)

.. note:: All configuration files can be overridden by environment. Learn more about multi-environment support in :ref:`engine-multi-environment-support`.

The configuration file ``site-config.xml`` has some additional considerations. This file can be defined in:
    - ``/config/engine/env/{envName}/site-config.xml``: This is the environment override, and is loaded first if present.
    - ``/config/engine/site-config.xml``: This is the main configuration file for the project/site. This file is loaded if the environment override is not present.

.. note:: All properties will be available for developers in the Freemarker templates and Groovy scripts using the ``siteConfig`` variable. The ``siteConfig`` variable is an instance of the `XMLConfiguration <https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/XMLConfiguration.html>`_ class.

.. _engine-instance-configuration-files:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Instance-level Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The main files for configuring Crafter Engine at the instance level are:

.. list-table:: Engine Instance Level Configuration Files
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Configuration File
      - Description
    * - ``server-config.properties``
      - Contains server configurable parameters such as URLs, paths, etc.
    * - ``services-context.xml``
      - Contains the bean definition for services layer
    * - ``rendering-context.xml``
      - Contains the bean definition for rendering
    * - ``logging.xml``
      - Contains loggers, appenders, etc.

These configuration files for Crafter Engine is located under  ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension``, where ``CRAFTER_HOME`` is the install directory of your CrafterCMS authoring or delivery environment.

The files can be accessed by opening the files using a text editor. Any changes made to any of the files listed above will require a restart of Crafter Engine.

.. _engine-root-folder:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Engine Root Folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Crafter Engine requires a root folder path to be configured if the defaults are not used.

The default root folder path has the pattern: ``crafter.engine.site.default.rootFolder.path=file:${CRAFTER_DATA_DIR}/repos/sites/{siteName}/`` This relies on the ``CRAFTER_DATA_DIR`` environment variable being set. Crafter Engine will then resolve the ``{siteName}`` variable to the name of the site being requested.

To change the root folder path, you can either set the ``CRAFTER_DATA_DIR`` environment variable or change the default root folder path in the ``server-config.properties`` file (see more about that file in :ref:`server-config.properties <engine-configuration-files>`. The variable to modify is:

    .. code-block:: properties
      :caption: *{delivery-env-directory}/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*

      crafter.engine.site.default.rootFolder.path=file:${CRAFTER_DATA_DIR}/repos/sites/{siteName}/

    |

|hr|

.. _engine-turn-off-show-error:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Turn Off Show Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Templates in CrafterCMS will display the errors in line with content as they encounter them to help the template developer during the coding process. On production environments, you do not want the errors to show up because it will highlight site issues and expose information that may be a security concern. To turn off showing errors in line with content, do the following:

#. Place the following property and value in the ``server-config.properties`` file

   .. code-block:: properties
       :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*

	   crafter.engine.template.error.displayInView=false

#. Restart the Crafter Engine application or the Tomcat service.

#. Test by deploying an FTL file with an error in it.
   Note that the error will not show up but is printed out in the server's log file.

.. _engine-http-response-headers:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
HTTP Response Headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CrafterCMS supports adding headers to responses when there are matched configuration patterns in
the Engine Project Configuration file |br|

To setup HTTP response headers, do the following:
- Configure the Ant path pattern to match for adding headers to response in **headerMappings.mapping.urlPattern**
- Configure the ``<header>`` element and the `<value>`` element ` with your desired values under **headerMappings.mapping.headers**.

.. code-block:: xml
    :emphasize-lines: 3, 6-7

    <headerMappings>
      <mapping>
        <urlPattern>/**/*.pdf</urlPattern>
        <headers>
          <header>
            <name>X-Crafter-Document</name>
            <value>true</value>
          </header>
        </headers>
      </mapping>
    </headerMappings>

.. _engine-cache-headers:

"""""""""""""""""""""
Setting Cache Headers
"""""""""""""""""""""
Cache headers allows specifying caching policies such as how an item is cached, maximum age before expiring, etc.
These headers are extremely useful for indicating cache TTLs to CDNs and browsers on certain requests.

To setup cache headers, do the following:

- Configure the Ant path pattern to match for adding headers to response in **headerMappings.mapping.urlPattern**
- Configure the ``<header>`` element with the value ``Cache-Control`` and the element ``<value>`` with your desired Cache-Control
  directive under **headerMappings.mapping.headers**.

  See `here <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control>`__ for a list of available directives
  to use with ``Cache-Control``.

Your configuration should look something like below:

.. code-block:: xml
    :emphasize-lines: 3, 6-7

    <headerMappings>
      <mapping>
        <urlPattern>/articles/**</urlPattern>
        <headers>
          <header>
            <name>Cache-Control</name>
            <value>max-age=60\, s-maxage=300</value>
          </header>
        <headers>
      </mapping>
    </headerMappings>


Please note that the ``Cache-Control`` header inserted to responses by default is set to ``No-Cache``.

.. _groovy-sandbox-configuration:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Groovy Sandbox Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When a Groovy script is executed all code is validated against a blacklist of insecure expressions to prevent code that could
compromise the system. When you try to execute a script that contains insecure expressions you will see an error
similar to this:

.. code-block:: none

  UnsupportedOperationException: Insecure call staticMethod java.lang.Runtime getRuntime ...

|

It is recommended to keep the default configuration if possible. However, if access to one or more of the blacklisted expressions
is required, it is possible to override the blacklist configuration. Configuration is global and affects all scripts on the server.

.. warning:: When you allow a script to make an insecure call you should make sure it can only be executed with known
             arguments and **never** with unverified user input.

|

"""""""""""""""""""""""""
Groovy Sandbox Properties
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
The following allows you to configure the Groovy sandbox.
The Groovy sandbox is enabled by default and can be disabled by changing the property ``crafter.engine.groovy.sandbox.enable`` to ``false``.

.. code-block:: properties
   :linenos:
   :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*

   # Indicates if the sandbox should be enabled for all sites
   crafter.engine.groovy.sandbox.enable=true
   # Indicates if the blacklist should be enabled for all sites (this will have no effect if the sandbox is disabled)
   crafter.engine.groovy.sandbox.blacklist.enable=true
   # The location of the default blacklist to use for all sites (this will have no effect if the sandbox is disabled)
   crafter.engine.groovy.sandbox.blacklist.path=classpath:crafter/engine/groovy/blacklist

|

""""""""""""""""""""""""
Using a Custom Blacklist
""""""""""""""""""""""""
Crafter Engine includes a default blacklist that you can find
`here <https://github.com/craftercms/engine/blob/develop/src/main/resources/crafter/engine/groovy/blacklist>`_. Make sure you review the branch/tag you're using.

To use a custom blacklist follow these steps:

#. Copy the default blacklist file to your classpath, for example:

    ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/groovy/blacklist``

#. Remove or comment (adding a ``#`` at the beginning of the line) the expressions that your scripts require
#. Update the :ref:`server-config.properties <engine-configuration-files>` configuration file to load the custom blacklist:

    .. code-block:: none
      :caption: ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties``

      # The location of the blacklist to use for all sites (this will have no effect if the sandbox is disabled)
      crafter.engine.groovy.sandbox.blacklist.path=classpath:crafter/engine/extension/groovy/blacklist

    .. note::
      In CrafterCMS v3.1.14 and prior, the name of the property is ``crafter.engine.groovy.sandbox.blacklist``

#. Restart CrafterCMS

Now you can execute the same script without any issues.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Disabling the Sandbox Blacklist
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
It is possible to disable the blacklist to allow the execution of most expressions, in
case you need to use a considerable number of the expression included in the blacklist while keeping some basic
restrictions. To disable the blacklist for all projects/sites update the server configuration file
:ref:`server-config.properties <engine-configuration-files>`:

.. code-block:: none
  :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*

  # Indicates if the blacklist should be enabled for all sites (this will have no effect if the sandbox is disabled)
  crafter.engine.groovy.sandbox.blacklist.enable=false


"""""""""""""""
Important Notes
"""""""""""""""
There are some limitations that should be noted when working with the Groovy Sandbox.

One limitation is that an exception is thrown during execution when a Groovy class has a property and a getter method for the property. Here's an example code that throws an exception during execution:
   .. code-block::

      class Test {
        private String message

        public String getMessage() {
           return this.message
        }
      }

      def t = new Test()
      t.message = "this is a test"

      return t.getMessage()

   |

Here's the error thrown in the logs by the code above:

**Workarounds**

There are a couple of things you can do to get around the exception being thrown:

* Do not use getter methods and instead access the property directly |br|
  Using the example above, we'll access the property directly:

     .. code-block::

        class Test {
          private String message
        }

        def t = new Test()
        t.message = "this is a test"

        return t.message

     |

* Use a different name for the property and the getter method |br|
  Again, using the example above, we'll use a different name from the property for the getter method:

     .. code-block::

        class Test {
          private String theMessage

          public String getMessage() {
             return this.theMessage
          }
        }

        def t = new Test()
        t.theMessage = "this is a test"

        return t.getMessage()

URL rewriting turns hard to remember, long and complicated URLs into easier to remember URLs.

CrafterCMS comes with the Tuckey URLRewrite filter, a Java Web Filter with functionality like Apache's mod_rewrite,
that lets you setup rewrite rules for your site.

To add a URL rewrite rule, in Studio, open the **Sidebar** then click on |projectTools|. Click on **Configuration**
then select **Engine URL Rewrite Configuration (XML Style)**.

where:

- ``<accessControlAllowOrigin>`` values are split using ``,``. Remember that
  commas inside patterns need to be escaped with a ``\``,
  like this: ``<accessControlAllowOrigin>http://localhost:[8000\,3000],http://*.other.domain</accessControlAllowOrigin>``

- ``<accessControlAllowMethods>`` and ``<accessControlAllowHeaders>`` values are split using ``,``. Remember to escape the commas ``,`` separating
  the values like this: ``<accessControlAllowHeaders>X-Custom-Header\, Content-Type</accessControlAllowHeaders>`` or
  ``<accessControlAllowMethods>GET\, OPTIONS</accessControlAllowMethods>``

.. note::
    When engine is in preview mode, it is a proxy and therefore will not add CORS headers to REST API responses even if CORS is enabled.

.. _proxy-configuration:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Proxy Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CrafterCMS supports a proxy system to proxy GraphQL, Engine, NodeJS or other application delivery systems. Whenever Crafter Engine receives a request, it is matched against the patterns of each server and the first match would then get the request sent to the server with the matching pattern. In some systems, multiple servers are used for search, Studio, etc. Using the proxy helps simplify the system.

One of the benefits of using the proxy in CrafterCMS is that it can connect to any remote server as the preview server, which allows for easier authoring of projects built with other programming languages and technology, React, Angular, or Vue for example.

The proxy configuration file contains configuration for the preview proxy servers.
To modify the proxy configuration, click on |projectTools| from the bottom of the *Sidebar*, then click on **Configuration** and select **Proxy Config** from the dropdown list.

""""""""""""""""""""
Proxy Example: React
""""""""""""""""""""
For example, you would like to work on a React application within Studio. What is normally included inside Studio is the build output of the React application, so that a user making edits to the React code would need to build the React code then copy it into Studio in order to preview the changes. This becomes cumbersome when developing, as many edits are normally done before reaching the final version of the React app. Using the proxy, the user can preview the React app in Studio and is able to work on both the React app and CrafterCMS.

Let's take a look at an example of setting up the proxy for a React application.

We'll look at the Video Center Blueprint, a React application available from the public marketplace, that runs on ``localhost:3000``, then setup the Studio proxy so we can preview the React application inside Studio. Finally, we'll make some changes in the React application and view the changes made inside Studio.

Let's begin:

#. Setup the React application.

   * Clone the video center blueprint by running ``git clone https://github.com/craftercms/video-center-blueprint.git``

       .. code-block:: sh

          ➜ git clone https://github.com/craftercms/video-center-blueprint.git
          Cloning into 'video-center-blueprint'...
          remote: Enumerating objects: 6433, done.
          remote: Total 6433 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 6433
          Receiving objects: 100% (6433/6433), 77.12 MiB | 4.92 MiB/s, done.
          Resolving deltas: 100% (4041/4041), done.

   * Run the React application

     Inside the video center blueprint folder that we just cloned above, navigate to ``video-center-blueprint/sources/app``.
     We need ``yarn`` installed in your system. Running ``yarn`` with no command will run ``yarn install``. In the example below, yarn is already installed in the system

       .. code-block:: sh

          ➜  app git:(master) yarn
          yarn install v1.22.4
          [1/4] 🔍  Resolving packages...
          success Already up-to-date.
          ✨  Done in 0.68s.

     Build the React application by running ``yarn start``

       .. code-block:: sh

          ➜  app git:(master) yarn start
          yarn run v1.22.4
          $react-scripts start

          Compiled successfully!

          You can now view video-center-blueprint in the browser.

          Local:            http://localhost:3000/
          On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.135:3000/

          Note that the development build is not optimized.
          To create a production build, use yarn build.

     The command above will open a browser window where we can view the app

     .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/vcbp-preview.webp
        :alt: Video Center Blueprint preview on "localhost:3000"
        :width: 70 %
        :align: center

     |

   * Edit the base url in your React app to the server we are using for development, which in our case, is the Studio server, on ``localhost:8080``, and the websocket port for hot module reloading (Crafter does not proxy websocket so you will need to point to the origin server of the websocket), then save the changes and restart the React server.

     To edit the base url, navigate to ``video-center-blueprint/sources/app`` then open the ``.env.development`` file using your favorite editor and set the following variables: ``REACT_APP_BASE_URL`` and ``WDS_SOCKET_PORT``

       .. code-block:: text
          :emphasize-lines: 6,12
          :caption: *video-center-blueprint/sources/app/.env.development*

          # A blank REACT_APP_SITE_NAME variable will make the app
          # try to find the crafterSite cookie which, provided you're
          # running both your local crafter and node dev web server for
          # the app are the same, it should be set for you when you created
          # the project. Manually set the here otherwise.
          REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

          # If you're using the CrafterCMS's Preview Proxy to view the dev mode app inside Preview,
          # configuring the port makes live reload work inside the CrafterCMS Preview frame.
          # If you're using any other port to run your webpack dev server, you should adjust this to
          # that port too.
          WDS_SOCKET_PORT=3000

     For Windows users on Docker, add ``DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true`` to the ``.env.development`` file. |br|
     Setting the environment variable ``DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK`` to ``true`` disables the host check, which allows us to pretend that the the host header of the request and the listening address of the host are running on the same host and port which is important since browsers block cross-origin requests. If not set, the user will see an ``Invalid Host header`` message in Studio. Remember that **disabling the host check is insecure and should only be used in a development environment**.

     Remember to restart the React server for the settings to take effect.

       .. note:: If you're using the create-react-app, please note that ``react-scripts`` versions earlier than 3.4.0 does not support custom sockjs pathname for hot reloading the server. Make sure that your ``react-scripts`` version used is 3.4.0 or above for the live reload work inside CrafterCMS to work.

#. Setup Studio

   * Create a project using the video center blueprint from the Public Marketplace.

     From the **Main Menu**, click on **Project**, then click on the **Create Project** button. This will open the **Create Site** dialog. Look for **Video Center**, then click on the **Use** button, fill in the required information then click on the **Review** button, then finally the **Create Site** button. This **Video Center** blueprint we selected from the Marketplace is the same react application

     .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/vcbp-marketplace.webp
        :alt: Select Video Center blueprint from the Public Marketplace
        :width: 70 %
        :align: center

     |


   * Setup the proxy for the video center React application we started above

     Open the **Sidebar**, click on |projectTools|, then click on **Configuration**. Select **Proxy Config** from the dropdown menu.

     .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/config-open-proxy-config.webp
        :alt: Configurations - Open Proxy Configuration
        :width: 55 %
        :align: center

     |

     Scroll down to the ``preview`` server and edit the ``url`` to point to the url used for the React application (``localhost:3000``) we setup in the beginning. Save your changes.

       .. code-block:: xml
          :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/sandbox/SITENAME/sandbox/config/engine/proxy-config.xml*
          :emphasize-lines: 3

          <server>
            <id>preview</id>
            <url>http://localhost:3000</url>
            <patterns>
              <pattern>.*</pattern>
            </patterns>
          </server>

     For users running Studio on Docker, use ``http://host.docker.internal:3000`` for the ``url`` of the React application. Docker containers can access local services running on the host by connecting to ``host.docker.internal``. See https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds for more information on connecting from a container to a service on the host.

     At this point, the preview we are seeing in Studio should be the one from our React application.

   * Modify the React application then verify that we can preview the changes made inside Studio.

     For this part, we'll change the text ``Featured Channels`` in the home page to ``My Featured Channels``. Using your favorite editor, in your React app, navigate to ``video-center-blueprint/sources/app/src/containers/Home`` and open the ``Home.js`` file. Scroll down to the line with ``key: 'featured-channels'`` and edit the ``value``:

       .. code-block:: js
          :emphasize-lines: 3

          {
            key: 'featured-channels',
            value: 'My Featured Channels',
            type: 'channel-card-alt',
            ...

     Save your changes. Notice that in the React app preview (localhost:3000), the page is reloaded with our changes now visible. Now let's take a look at Studio. Notice that Studio preview has reloaded and the changes we made in the React app is now visible.

     .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/vcbp-react-app-edited.webp

^^^^^
Cache
^^^^^
Crafter Engine sports a built-in cache engine with an LRU (least recently used) cache eviction policy. The cache is used to store an active set to help render content from memory whenever possible.

.. note:: When running in Preview Mode (inside Studio for preview purposes), Crafter Engine's cache is disabled to help authors see their changes immediately.

"""""""""

"""""""""
The following allows you to configure the maximum number of objects in Engine's cache:

.. code-block:: properties

   # The max number of items that each site cache can have
   crafter.engine.site.default.cache.maxAllowedItems=250000

"""""""""""""
Cache Warming

The following allows you to configure items to be warmed up (preloaded) in the cache:

.. code-block:: properties
    :emphasize-lines: 7,10,13

    #################
    # Cache Warm Up #
    #################
    # Indicates if cache warming should be enabled. This means the site cache will be warmed up (according to a list of

    # current one
    crafter.engine.site.cache.warmUp.enabled=false
    # The descriptor folders that need to be preloaded in cache, separated by comma. Specify the preload depth with
    # :{depth} after the path. If no depth is specified, the folders will be fully preloaded.
    crafter.engine.site.cache.warmUp.descriptor.folders=/site:3
    # The content folders that need to be preloaded in cache, separated by comma. Specify the preload depth with
    # :{depth} after the path. If no depth is specified, the folders will be fully preloaded.
    crafter.engine.site.cache.warmUp.content.folders=/scripts,/templates

where:

  - The descriptor folders are paths that contain XML that needs to be parsed, loaded and merged e.g. for inheritance.
    Most of the time this would be folders under ``/site``

  - The content folders are mostly static, non-processed content, e.g. scripts, templates, static-assets

For all projects, the cache is preloaded using the above configuration. CrafterCMS warms up the cache on every publish and startup. Note also that what's cache warmed will be warmed on every publish and startup and will live as long as nothing kicks it out of the cache due to least recently used (LRU) cache.

.. _engine-project-spring-configuration:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Spring Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each project can have it's own Spring application context. Just as with site-config.xml, beans
can be overwritten using the following locations:

Spring Configuration Files
 - ``/config/engine/application-context.xml`` (This file can be accessed easily from any project created
   through the out-of-the-box blueprints, by navigating from the Studio sidebar to ``Project Tools``
   > ``Configuration``, and finally picking up the ``Engine Project Application Context`` option from the dropdown).

	 .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/engine-project-application-context.webp
			 :alt: Engine Project Application Context

 - ``/config/engine/env/{envName}/application-context.xml``

The application context inherits from Engine's own service-context.xml, and any class in Engine's
classpath can be used, including Groovy classes declared under ``/scripts/classes/*``.

As an example, assuming you have defined a Groovy class under ``/scripts/classes/mypackage/MyClass.groovy``,
you can define a bean like this:

.. code-block:: xml
  :caption: application-context.xml
  :linenos:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"

    <bean id="greeting" class="mypackage.MyClass">
      <property name="myproperty" value="${myvalue}"/>
    </bean>

  </beans>

A ``org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`` (like above) can be
specified in the context so that the properties of ``site-config.xml`` can be used as placeholders,
like ``${myvalue}``. By making the placeholder configurer inherit from crafter.properties, you'll
also have access to Engine's global properties (like ``crafter.engine.preview``).

.. note::
    Crafter Engine will not be able to load your Project Context if your context file contains invalid XML,
    incorrect configuration or if your beans do not properly handle their own errors on initialization.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Configure Engine to use MongoDB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are times when you may need access to MongoDB. This section details how you can access MongoDB by configuring Engine.

Here are the steps for configuring Engine to use mongoDB:

"""""""""""""""""""""""""
Configure the MongoDB URI
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
To define the connection between MongoDB and Engine, add the URI in the config file `/config/engine/site-config.xml`. (This file can be accessed easily from any project created through the out-of-the-box blueprints, by navigating from the Studio sidebar to Project Tools > Configuration, and finally picking up the **Engine Project Configuration** option from the dropdown).

.. code-block:: xml

    <site>
      <db>
          <uri>mongodb://{host}:{port}/{database}?readPreference=primary&amp;maxPoolSize=50&amp;minPoolSize=5&amp;maxIdleTimeMS=1000&amp;waitQueueMultiple=200&amp;waitQueueTimeoutMS=100&amp;w=1&amp;journal=true</uri>
      </db>
    </site>

where:
   * {host} - required, server address to connect to
   * {port} - optional, with a default value of :27020 in CrafterCMS Authoring
   * {database} - optional, name of the database to authenticate if the connection string includes authentication credentials.

For more details on the Connection String URI format, see https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/

""""""""""""""""""""""
Create a GMongo Client
""""""""""""""""""""""
To access Mongo from Groovy, we'll use a GMongo client. We'll need to add some beans in `/config/engine/application-context.xml`. (This file can be accessed easily from any project created through the out-of-the-box blueprints, by navigating from the Studio sidebar to Project Tools > Configuration, and finally picking up the **Engine Site Application Context** option from the dropdown).

.. code-block:: xml
    :linenos:

    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

       <bean class="org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer" parent="crafter.properties"/>

       <bean id="mongoUri" class="com.mongodb.MongoClientURI">
         <constructor-arg value="${db.uri}"/>
       </bean>

       <bean id="mongoClient" class="com.gmongo.GMongoClient">
         <constructor-arg ref="mongoUri"/>
       </bean>

    </beans>

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Use the Client From a Groovy Script
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
We can now use the client from a Groovy script. Here's a simple script that runs a query:

.. code-block:: groovy
    :linenos:

    def mongo = applicationContext.mongoClient
    def db = mongo.getDB("{database}")
    def result = null
    def record = db.{collection}.findOne(_id: "{some id}")
    if (record) {
        result = record.name
    }
    return result

where:
    * {database} - the name of an existing database
    * {collection} - collection name
    * {some id} - id you're searching for depending on your database

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Publish Configuration to Delivery
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Until this point all changes have been made from Crafter Studio so they will only affect immediately
the authoring environment, for a delivery environment you will need to publish the changed files.

This can be done from the Studio project dashboard with the following steps:

1. Go to Studio's project dashboard via the Navigation Menu on the top right or via the Sidebar

   .. image:: /_static/images/content-author/project-dashboard-sidebar.webp
       :width: 65 %
       :align: center
       :alt: Studio - Project Dashboard from Sidebar

2. Locate the ``Unpublished Work`` dashlet

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/mongo/my-recent-activity.webp
      :alt: Studio Project Dashboard - My Recent Activity
      :width: 70 %
      :align: center

3. Select all configuration files updated in the previous sections

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/mongo/my-recent-activity-config.webp
      :alt: Studio Project Dashboard - My Recent Activity
      :width: 70 %
      :align: center

4. Click ``Publish`` from the contextual menu

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/mongo/approve-and-publish-context-menu.webp
      :alt: Studio Project Dashboard - Contextual Menu
      :width: 70 %
      :align: center

5. Click ``Publish`` to close the publish dialog

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/mongo/publish-dialog.webp
      :alt: Studio Project Dashboard - Publish Dialog
      :width: 70 %
      :align: center

Once the files are deployed to the delivery node and the project context is reloaded the new
Configuration will take effect.

Engine Multi-Environment Support
--------------------------------
The following engine configuration files can be setup for different environments:

* ``site-config.xml``
* ``application-context.xml``
* ``urlrewrite.xml``

To setup an environment for engine configuration files, do the following:

#. Create a folder under ``data/repos/sites/${site}/sandbox/config/engine`` called ``env``
#. Inside the folder, create a directory called ``myenv`` (or whatever you want to call the environment)
#. Copy the configuration file you want to override in the new environment you are setting up, inside your ``myenv`` folder
#. Remember to commit the files copied so Studio will pick it up.
#. In the ``crafter-setenv.sh`` file in ``TOMCAT/bin`` set the
   following property to desired environment:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :caption: *bin/crafter-setenv.sh*

         # -------------------- Configuration variables --------------------

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Creating a Custom Environment Example
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Let's take a look at an example of creating a new environment, called ``mycustomenv`` with the ``urlrewrite.xml``
file overridden in the new environment for a project created using the Website Editorial blueprint.  This example
is very similar to the example shown above for Studio except for the location of the custom configuration file:

#. We'll create a folder called ``env`` under ``data/repos/sites/my-editorial/sandbox/config/engine``

      .. code-block:: text
         :linenos:
         :emphasize-lines: 8

         data/
           repos/
             sites/
               my-editorial/
                 sandbox/
                   config/
                     engine/
                       env/

      |

#. Inside the ``env`` folder, create a directory called ``mycustomenv``
#. We will now create the configuration file for the ``urlrewrite.xml`` that we want to override in the new environment we are setting up, inside our ``mycustomenv`` folder:

      .. code-block:: text
         :emphasize-lines: 3

             env/
               mycustomenv/
                 urlrewrite.xml

     |

   We will redirect the page to ``/articles/2021/12/Top Books For Young Women`` when the page ``/articles/2020/12/Top Books For Young Women`` is previewed. Copy the following inside the ``urlrewrite.xml`` file.

     .. code-block:: xml
        :linenos:
        :caption: *Urlrewrite.xml file for environment mycustomenv*

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <urlrewrite>
          <rule>
            <from>/articles/2020/12/(.*)$</from>
            <to type="redirect">/articles/2021/12/$1</to>
          </rule>
        </urlrewrite>

     |

   For our example, the folder ``articles/2020/12`` was copied to ``articles/2021`` with the page under ``articles/2021/12``, modified to display the title as a dupe. This was done so when we click on the page under ``articles/2020/12``, we can easily tell that it's being redirected to the page under ``articles/2021/12``. Of course, you can also just look at the url of the page previewed to verify that it was redirected to the right page.

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/env-copy-page-for-urlrewrite.webp
       :align: center

      :align: center
      :alt: Page we want to be redirected to

#. Remember to commit the files copied so Studio will pick it up.

      .. code-block:: bash

         ➜  sandbox git:(master) ✗ git add .
         ➜  sandbox git:(master) ✗ git commit -m "Add urlrewrite.xml file for mycustomenv"

      |

#. Open the ``crafter-setenv.sh`` file in ``TOMCAT/bin`` and set the value of ``CRAFTER_ENVIRONMENT`` to the
   environment we setup above (*myenv*) to make it the active environment:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :caption: *bin/crafter-setenv.sh*

         # -------------------- Configuration variables --------------------
         export CRAFTER_ENVIRONMENT=${CRAFTER_ENVIRONMENT:=mycustomenv}

      |

#. Restart Crafter. To verify our newly setup environment, open the ``Sidebar`` and click on |projectTools|, then select ``Configuration``. Notice that the active environment ``mycustomenv`` will be displayed on top of the configurations drop-down box and when you select the *Engine URL Rewrite Configuration (XML Style)*, it should display the file we created in one of the previous step:

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/env-custom-configurations.webp
      :align: center
      :alt: Active Environment Displayed in Project Tools Configuration

   |

   Let's verify that our *urlrewrite.xml* is in effect. From the *Sidebar*, click on *Home* -> *Entertainment* -> *Top Books For Young Women*  or, navigate to */articles/2020/12/* and click on *Top Books For Young Women*.

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/env-preview-page.webp
      :align: center
      :alt: Preview the page mentioned in the urlrewrite.xml that will be redirected

   The preview page should take you to */articles/2021/12/Top Books For Young Women*

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Environment Specific Configurations Example
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Environments are useful for managing values such as paths or database connections without the need to
change any code directly in the servers.

In this example, we show how to manage a database connection that will change depending on the server
where the project is deployed. We will have three environments ``dev``, ``auth`` and ``delivery``

#. First create the environments by following the example above for creating the environments.
   We'll then have the following folders called ``dev``, ``auth`` and ``delivery`` under ``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/SITENAME/sandbox/config/engine/env``

#. Next, include the appropriate connection string for each environment in the ``site-config.xml`` file:

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *Local Development Configuration: /config/engine/env/dev/site-config.xml*
      :linenos:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <site>
        <db>
          <uri>mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb?maxPoolSize=1&amp;minPoolSize=0&amp;maxIdleTimeMS=10000</uri>
        </db>
      </site>


   .. code-block:: xml
       :caption: *Authoring Configuration: /config/engine/env/auth/site-config.xml*
       :linenos:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <site>
         <db>
           <uri>mongodb://localhost:27020/mydb?maxPoolSize=5&amp;minPoolSize=2&amp;maxIdleTimeMS=10000</uri>
         </db>
       </site>


   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *Delivery Configuration: /config/engine/env/delivery/site-config.xml*
      :linenos:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <site>
        <db>
          <uri>mongodb://delivery-db-server:27020/delivery-db?maxPoolSize=10&amp;minPoolSize=5&amp;maxIdleTimeMS=1000</uri>
        </db>
      </site>

   Remember to commit the files copied so Studio will pick it up.

#. Finally, notice when using this approach the code is completely independent of the environment so we only need one
   bean that will always connect to the right database:

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *Default Application Context: /config/engine/application-context.xml (shared by all environments)*
      :linenos:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

.. _engine-multi-target-configurations:

---------------------------
Engine Multi-target Support
---------------------------
There are some cases where the Engine configuration files need to have different values per publishing target. Say for a production environment where you have **staging** to test out your project and **live** , the project to be used by end users, you may need different SAML authentication mechanics or different URL rewrites.

The :ref:`engine-multi-environment-support` section detailed how to setup Engine configuration files per environment. CrafterCMS
supports overriding Engine configuration files, not just per environment, but also per publishing target.
It supports a base configuration per environment with the ability to override per publishing target.

The following engine configuration files can be setup for different publishing targets:

* site-config.xml
* application-context.xml
* urlrewrite.xml

Here are the available publishing targets for the configuration files listed above:

* preview
* staging
* live

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Overriding Engine Configuration Files per Publishing Target
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To override a configuration file in any of the publishing targets

#. Add the new configuration file/s for overriding to **Configurations** under |projectTools| -> **Configuration**

      :alt: Multi-target Configuration - Open Configurations
      :width: 45 %
      :align: center

   |

   The overriding configuration file should be named **configuration-to-be-overridden.publishing-target.xml**. Depending on the publishing target you wish the configuration file to override, the files should look like one of the following:

   - *configuration-to-be-overridden.preview.xml*
   - *configuration-to-be-overridden.staging.xml*
   - *configuration-to-be-overridden.live.xml*

   |

   Say, to add a ``urlrewrite.xml`` file override for **staging**, add the following in the **Configurations**

     .. code-block:: xml
        :caption: *Configurations* - *SITENAME/config/studio/administration/config-list.xml*

System Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. warning:: This setting will disable restrictions for all projects/sites

|

System objects like ``servletContext`` cannot be exposed by adding them to a list, instead you will need to change
the following configuration in the :ref:`server-config.properties <engine-configuration-files>` file:

.. code-block:: none
  :caption: ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties``

  # Expose all services
  crafter.engine.disableVariableRestrictions=true

Adding Dependencies with Grape
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If your Groovy code need to use external dependencies you can use Grapes, however, when the Groovy sandbox is enabled
dependencies can only be downloaded during the initial compilation and not during runtime. For this reason it is
required to add an extra parameter ``initClass=false`` in the annotations to prevent them to be copied to the classes:

.. code-block:: groovy
  :caption: Example grapes annotations

  @Grab(group='org.apache.commons', module='commons-pool2', version='2.8.0', initClass=false)
  @Grab(value='org.apache.commons:commons-pool2:2.8.0', initClass=false)
