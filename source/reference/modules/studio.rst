Crafter Studio provides all the content management services and integrates with repositories like Git, Alfresco and other CMIS based platforms to enable authoring, management, and publishing of all content.

|hr|

.. _studio-config:

-------------
Configuration
-------------
Crafter Studio is primarily configured via a single configuration file, ``studio-config.yaml``, and 2 override files that can be used to override the settings in the core configuration file.

The core configuration file for Crafter Studio ``studio-config.yaml`` is located under ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/webapps/studio/WEB-INF/classes/crafter/studio`` and contains pre-configured settings.

.. warning:: Do not change the ``studio-config.yaml`` file directly; override the settings you want to change in one of the override files.

The override files are:

* Studio Configuration Override file **studio-config-override.yaml** located under ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension`` can be accessed by opening the file using your favorite editor
* Global Studio Configuration Override file **studio-config-override.yaml** located under ``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/global/configuration`` can be accessed from Studio from the ``Navigation Menu`` under ``Global Config``

The configuration loading order is as follows:

* ``studio-config.yaml`` from the WAR file is loaded first
* ``studio-config-override.yaml`` from the shared folder is loaded next (if it exists)
* ``studio-config-override.yaml`` from the global configuration folder is loaded last (if it exists)

If the same property is present in multiple files, the value from the last configuration file will be used.

You'll note that the first override file from the ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension`` folder resides on the local file system. This makes it easy for system admins but will not replicate across a cluster. The second override file from the ``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/global/configuration`` folder is a repository item and will replicate across a cluster. Furthermore, the second override file can be managed from Studio without the need to access the file system. See :ref:`nav-menu-global-config` for more information on how to access the global configuration file from Studio.

.. note:: Changing the configuration files requires a restart of Crafter Studio for the changes to take effect.
.. note:: Environment variables can be used to override any property defined as ``${env:ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE}`` in the configuration files. This allows you to inject these properties into a vanilla installation without modifying any actual files, which is especially useful when using Docker or Kubernetes. See :ref:`here <environment-variables>` for a list of environment variables used by CrafterCMS.

where:

- The environment variables (*env:VARIABLE_NAME*) values are set in the ``crafter-setenv.sh`` file. See :ref:`here <env-var-serverless-deployments>` for more information on environment variables used in serverless deployments

Remember to encrypt your credentials. For more information on how to manage/encode your secrets such as AWS credentials,
please see :ref:`managing-secrets`

For better security and control, we recommend setting an AWS profile via the ``crafter-setenv.sh`` file instead of
configuring the encrypted credentials in the blob stores configuration file. This allows you to have an IAM user
per developer, which is a better approach than a single user whose credentials are included (encrypted) in the
configuration file. In this way, if you need to rotate or remove the credentials of a single user, the access of
other users won't be affected.

To set an AWS profile, using your favorite editor, open ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/crafter-setenv.sh`` and add the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AWS_PROFILE=YOUR_AWS_PROFILE

|

*where* ``YOUR_AWS_PROFILE`` is the AWS profile you wish to use for the blob store. See :ref:`here <aws-profile-configuration>`
for more information on configuring AWS profiles.

When using an AWS profile, you can now remove the ``<credentials />`` section in your blob stores configuration file.

Remember to restart your CrafterCMS install for the changes you made to take effect.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using AWS Service Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CrafterCMS supports AWS access without using access/secret keys, by setting AWS service roles on your machine

Simply follow the instructions here for attaching an IAM role to your instance:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#attach-iam-role

Remember to remove the ``<credentials />`` section in your blob stores configuration file.

.. _publishing-assets-from-blob-stores:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Publishing Assets from the Blob Stores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CrafterCMS supports managing assets in external storage through workflow and publishing mechanics.
This allows uploading assets to an external storage for preview, that can then be published to either a live or a staging
(depending on if staging is setup for your Crafter install) external storage, thus making the external assets available
to delivery only after the assets have been published to the live external storage.

The external storage could be in the cloud, such as AWS S3 or some other storage solution that is outside of where CrafterCMS is installed.

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Configuring the External Storage
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
First we'll need to setup the external storage to be used by CrafterCMS.
To setup an external storage for assets, open the **Sidebar**, then click on |projectTools| -> *Configurations*. Select ``Blob Stores`` from the dropdown and fill in the required information.

.. code-block:: xml

   <blobStore>
     <id/>
     <type/>
     <pattern/>
     <mappings>
       <mapping>
         <publishingTarget/>
         <storeTarget/>
         <prefix/>
       </mapping>
     </mappings>
     <configuration/>
   </blobStore>

|

To see more information on the Blob Stores configuration, see :ref:`above <blob-stores>`

After setting up the ``Blob Stores`` configuration, you may now use the external storage for uploading using the various upload methods provided by Crafter Studio, and publishing to live or staging if it's setup.

'''''''
Example
'''''''
Let's take a look at an example of setting up an external storage for preview, staging and live and then uploading and finally publishing assets to the external storage we setup. In the example, we will use AWS S3 as the external storage and the Website Editorial blueprint in Crafter Studio to create our project.

**Prerequisites:**

#. Project created using the Website Editorial blueprint.
#. AWS S3 bucket/s. A single bucket can be used as long as all the ``publishingTarget`` uses a unique ``prefix``, or a separate bucket can be created for each ``publishingTarget``, or a combination of both.

   For our example, we will be using two buckets. One for authoring and another for delivery. The following buckets were setup in AWS S3: *my-authoring-bucket* for authoring (used by publishing target ``preview`` with the prefix *sandbox* and publishing target ``staging`` with the prefix *staging*) and *my-deli-bucket* for delivery.

**Here are the steps:**

#. Enable staging (optional)
#. Setup the blob store
#. Upload files
#. Publish the files to staging (if setup)
#. Publish the files into live

Let's begin:

1. Enable Staging (optional)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
This step is optional but for our example, we wanted to be able to publish to staging, so in this step, we will first enable staging. In your Studio, click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *Project Configuration* and set ``enable-staging-environment`` to ``true`` to enable staging

  .. code-block:: xml
     :emphasize-lines: 2

     <published-repository>
         <enable-staging-environment>true</enable-staging-environment>
         <staging-environment>staging</staging-environment>
         <live-environment>live</live-environment>
     </published-repository>

  |

For more information on staging, see :ref:`staging-env`


2. Setup Blob Store
'''''''''''''''''''
In your Studio, click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *Blob Stores* and fill in the required information to setup the S3 buckets for the preview, staging and live.

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/sandbox/SITENAME/sandbox/config/studio/blob-stores-config.xml*
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 5,9,14,19,24,25,27

          <type>s3BlobStore</type>
          <pattern>/static-assets/item/.*</pattern>
          <mappings>
            <mapping>
              <publishingTarget>preview</publishingTarget>
              <storeTarget>my-authoring-bucket</storeTarget>
              <prefix>sandbox</prefix>
            </mapping>
            <mapping>
              <publishingTarget>staging</publishingTarget>
              <storeTarget>my-authoring-bucket</storeTarget>
              <prefix>staging</prefix>
            </mapping>
            <mapping>
              <publishingTarget>live</publishingTarget>
              <storeTarget>my-delivery-bucket</storeTarget>
            </mapping>
          </mappings>
          <configuration>
            <credentials>
              <accessKey>xxxxxxxxx</accessKey>
              <secretKey>xxxxxxxxx</secretKey>
            </credentials>
            <region>us-west-1</region>
            <pathStyleAccess>true</pathStyleAccess>
          </configuration>
        </blobStore>
      </blobStores>

   |

**where the highlighted items above refers to:**

* **pattern:** the regex to match file paths (the path in Studio that when used will access the external storage, ``/static-assets/item/.*`` for our example above)
* **mappings.mapping.storeTarget:** the name of the storeTarget inside the store (AWS S3 buckets, ``my-authoring-bucket`` and ``my-deli-bucket`` for our example above)
* **configuration:** configuration specific for the store type (For AWS S3, it requires credentials to access the buckets)

Remember to encrypt your credentials. For more information on how to manage/encode your secrets such as AWS credentials,
please see :ref:`managing-secrets`

To see more information on the Blob Stores configuration, see :ref:`above <blob-stores>`


3. Upload files
'''''''''''''''
There are various ways to upload files in Crafter Studio. Here's a few ways we can upload to the external storage:

#. Upload through a picker with corresponding data source setup in a content type
#. Upload using the ``Bulk Upload`` or ``Upload`` right-click option

Let's take a closer look:

#. One way of uploading files is through the use of a picker (image, video, item selector) with its corresponding data source with the ``Repository Path`` property set to the ``pattern`` we defined in the ``Blob Stores`` configuration file.

   For our example, open the **Page - Article** content type by opening the **Sidebar**, then click on |projectTools| -> *Content Types*, then choose the template name ``Page - Article``.

   In the **Page - Article** content type, notice that the ``Repository Path`` property of the ``Upload Image`` data source is set to: ``/static-assets/item/images/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/``, which falls into the file path pattern ``/static-assets/item/.*`` we setup in the ``Blob Stores`` configuration file

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/ext-storage/setup-datasource.webp
      :align: center
      :alt: Setup data source to use the file path pattern in Blob Stores
      :width: 95%

   Let's change the image used in one of the articles in the project.

   From the **Sidebar**, navigate to ``/articles/2016/6`` then right click on ``Coffee is Good for Your Health`` then select ``Edit``.

   Scroll down to the ``Content`` section, then click on the ``Replace`` button next to the **Image** field, then select ``Upload Images``. Select the file you want to upload. In our example, the file ``new1.png`` will be uploaded to ``static-assets/item/images/2020/03/27``.

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/ext-storage/upload-image-with-picker.webp
      :align: center
      :alt: Upload image using an image picker
      :width: 95%

   |

   After uploading the file, we should see it in the AWS S3 bucket for authoring ``my-authoring-bucket`` in the sandbox:

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/ext-storage/picker-uploaded-img-in-bucket.webp
      :align: center
      :alt: Image uploaded using the image picker is now in the S3 bucket
      :width: 95%

#. Next we'll try uploading using the ``Upload`` right-click option.

   Open the **Sidebar** and navigate to ``static-assets/item``. Create a folder named ``docs`` under ``item``. Right click on the newly created folder and select ``Upload`` to upload a single file, or ``Bulk Upload`` to upload multiple files

   In the example below, two files were uploaded to the ``docs`` folder.

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/ext-storage/uploaded-files-to-s3.webp
       :align: center
       :alt: "s3" folder created under "static-assets"
       :width: 35%

   |

   When you upload files to the ``docs`` folder, the files get uploaded to the ``sandbox`` of the ``my-authoring-bucket`` previously setup.

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/ext-storage/s3-preview-bucket.webp
       :align: center
       :alt: Files in preview in "s3" my-authoring-bucket
       :width: 85%

|


5. Publish the files to staging
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The next step in our example is to publish the files to ``staging``. To publish a file to ``staging``, navigate to the file in the ``Sidebar`` then right click on the file, and select ``Publish`` or open the ``Dashboard`` and select the file/s you want to publish to ``staging`` in the ``Unpublished Work`` widget and click on ``Publish`` from the context nav.

The ``Publish`` dialog will come up. Remember to select ``staging`` for the ``Publishing Target``

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/ext-storage/publish-to-staging.webp
    :align: center
    :alt: Publish file to staging in Studio
    :width: 65%

|

When the file/s are published to ``staging``, the files get published to the ``staging`` branch of the ``my-authoring-bucket`` in s3.

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/ext-storage/s3-staging-bucket.webp
    :align: center
    :alt: Published files to staging in "s3" my-authoring-bucket
    :width: 85%

|

6. Publish the files to delivery
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Finally, we'll publish the file/s to ``live``. To publish a file to ``live``, navigate to the file in the ``Sidebar`` then right click on the file, and select ``Publish`` or open the ``Dashboard`` and select the file/s you want to publish to ``live`` in the ``Unpublished Work`` widget and click on ``Approve & Publish`` from the context nav.

The ``Publish`` dialog will come up. Remember to select ``live`` for the ``Publishing Target``

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/ext-storage/publish-to-live.webp
    :align: center
    :alt: Publish file to live in Studio
    :width: 65%

|

When the file/s are published to ``live``, the file/s get published to the ``my-deli-bucket`` in s3.

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/ext-storage/s3-delivery-bucket.webp

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Setting up Staging for Existing Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When adding the ``staging`` publishing target to an established project that uses external storage, Studio does not clone the assets in external storage for ``live`` into ``staging``. Performing a bulk publish to ``staging`` also does not work at this time. This is because Studio does not publish to ``staging``, assets in a LIVE, UNEDITED state.

To sync the external storage for ``staging`` with ``live``, you must copy the assets in the ``live`` external storage to the ``staging`` external storage.

Let's take a look at an example of adding ``staging`` to an existing project.

**Prerequisites:**

#. Project created using the Website Editorial blueprint with external storage setup for ``live`` and assets already published to ``live`` (See example above for setting up external storage for a project. Remember to not setup ``staging`` as we will be doing it in this example)
#. AWS S3 bucket to be used by the ``staging`` publishing target. For our example, we will be using the bucket ``my-staging`` setup in AWS S3.

**Here are the steps:**

#. Enable staging in Studio
#. Setup the blob store in Studio
#. Copy assets in live to staging in external storage

Let's begin:

#. **Enable staging**

   In your Studio, click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *Project Configuration* and set ``enable-staging-environment`` to ``true`` to enable staging

     .. code-block:: xml
        :emphasize-lines: 2

        <published-repository>
          <enable-staging-environment>true</enable-staging-environment>
          <staging-environment>staging</staging-environment>
          <live-environment>live</live-environment>
        </published-repository>

     |

   For more information on staging, see :ref:`staging-env`

2. **Setup Blob Store**

   Setup ``staging`` in the Blob Store by adding the following to your ``Blob Stores`` configuration. In your Studio, click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *Blob Stores* and fill in the required information to setup the S3 bucket for staging.

     .. code-block:: xml

        <mapping>
          <publishingTarget>staging</publishingTarget>
          <storeTarget>my-staging</storeTarget>
        </mapping>

     |


   To see more information on the Blob Stores configuration, see :ref:`above <blob-stores>`

#. **Copy assets in** ``live`` **to** ``staging`` **in external storage**

   In your AWS console, copy the contents of your delivery bucket

      :align: center
      :alt: Copy assets in the delivery bucket

   |

   Paste the copied content into the staging bucket ``my-staging``

Project Policy
""""""""""""""
.. version_tag::
    :label: Since
    :version: 4.0.0

The project policy configuration file allows the administrator to configure constraints for content being added to the project
(via uploads), such as filename constraints, minimum/maximum size of files, permitted content types or file types (MIME-types), etc.

*Note that the project policy does not apply to content created directly on disk via the Git or APIs.*

CrafterCMS supports the following project policies:

- Filename allowed patterns and automatic renaming rules
- File size limits
- MIME-type limits
- Content-type limits

.. note::
    .. version_tag::
        :label: Since
        :version: 4.1.4

    The default policy for filenames and automatic renaming rules is to lowercase everything except items under: ``/scripts``, ``/templates``, and ``/static-assets/app``


To modify the project policy configuration, click on |projectTools| from the *Sidebar*, then click on **Configuration** and
select **Project Policy Configuration** from the list.

~~~~~~~~
Examples
~~~~~~~~
Let's take a look at some example project policy configurations.

''''''''''
Mime Types
''''''''''
The example configuration below (as seen in the default project policy configuration) disallows svg image
file uploads:

.. code-block:: xml
   :emphasize-lines: 7-9

      <!-- disable svg files -->
      <statement>
        <target-path-pattern>/.*</target-path-pattern>
        <permitted>
          <mime-types>*/*</mime-types>
        </permitted>
        <denied>
          <mime-types>image/svg+xml</mime-types>
        </denied>
      </statement>

Whenever a user tries to upload an svg image, the user will see a message on the screen informing them that
it doesn't comply with the project policies and can’t be uploaded like below:

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/project-policy-cannot-upload.webp
   :alt: Project Policy Configuration - Do not allow svg file uploads
   :width: 55 %
   :align: center

|

''''''''''''''''
File Size Limits
''''''''''''''''
Limiting file size of uploads is supported. Simply add ``<minimum-file-size/>`` and/or <maximum-file-size/>
under ``<permitted>`` where the minimum and maximum file sizes are in bytes

The example configuration below limits image uploads to less than 1MB in folder ``/static-assets/images/``.

.. code-block:: xml

   <!-- Example: only allow images of less than 1 MB -->
   <statement>
     <target-path-pattern>/static-assets/images/.*</target-path-pattern>
     <permitted>
       <maximum-file-size>1000000</maximum-file-size>
       <mime-types>image/*</mime-types>
     </permitted>
   </statement>

Whenever a user tries to upload an image that is larger than 1 MB in the ``/static-assets/images/`` folder, the user
will see a message on the screen informing them that it doesn’t comply with project policies and can’t be uploaded like below:

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/project-policy-img-too-big.webp
   :alt: Project Policy Configuration - Do not allow images greater than 1 MB
   :width: 55 %
   :align: center

|

''''''''''''''''''''
Transform File Names
''''''''''''''''''''
CrafterCMS supports transforming filenames of uploaded files and convert the filenames to lower case or upper case.
Simply set **caseTransform** to either ``lowercase`` or ``uppercase`` in ``target-regex`` to convert to your required case.

The example configuration below (as seen in the default project policy configuration) converts
parenthesis ( ``(`` and ``)`` ) and spaces in filenames to a dash ( ``-`` )
and lower cases all the letters in filenames for files uploaded to the ``/static-assets/`` folder .

.. code-block:: xml

   <statement>
     <target-path-pattern>/static-assets/.*</target-path-pattern>
     <permitted>
       <path>
         <source-regex>[\(\)\s]</source-regex>
         <target-regex caseTransform="lowercase">-</target-regex>
       </path>
     </permitted>
   </statement>

Whenever a user uploads a file with upper case letters or spaces and parenthesis in the filename, in the
``/static-assets/`` folder, the user will see a message on the screen informing them that it doesn’t comply
with project policies and will be asked if they would like to continue upload with the suggested name like below:

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/project-policy-convert-to-lower-case.webp

Enabling Staging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``staging`` publishing target is an intermediate publishing target where the project can be fully exercised.
To enable the ``staging`` publishing target, set the following to ``true``:

.. code-block:: xml

   <published-repository>
     <enable-staging-environment>false</enable-staging-environment>
   </published-repository>

|

See :ref:`staging-env` for more information on how to setup the ``staging`` publishing target

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Escaping Content Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To add/remove escaped content fields, modify the following:

.. code-block:: xml

   <!--
   Specifies the regular expression patterns to match content type field
   names that require CDATA escaping.
   -->
   <cdata-escaped-field-patterns>
     <pattern>(_html|_t|_s|_smv|mvs)$</pattern>
     <pattern>internal-name</pattern>
   </cdata-escaped-field-patterns>

|

For more information on escaping content fields, see the notes under :ref:`Variable Names and Search Indexing <variable-names-search-indexing>`

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Publishing Comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To make comments mandatory for different publishing methods, simply set to ``true`` any applicable methods the
site administrators want to require comments when publishing.

.. code-block:: xml

   <publishing>
     <comments>
       <!-- Global setting would apply to all -->
       <required>false</required>
       <!-- Additional (also optional) specific overrides -->
       <!-- <delete-required/> -->
       <!-- <bulk-publish-required/> -->
       <!-- <publish-by-commit-required/> -->
       <!-- <publish-required/> -->
     </comments>
   </publishing>

.. TODO: Is this the best place for content monitoring or project admin? It's now in both to some extent with project admin having the full article and this links to it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Content Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Content monitoring allows you to configure watches and notifications on your project. To add content monitors, add the following:

.. code-block:: xml

   <contentMonitoring>
     <monitor>
       <name>Content Expiring Tomorrow</name>
       <query>expired_dt:[now+1d/d TO now+2d/d]</query>
       <paths>
         <path>
           <name>All Site</name>
           <pattern>/site/.*</pattern>
           <emailTemplate>contentExpiringSoon</emailTemplate>
           <emails>admin@example.com</emails>
           <locale>en</locale>
         </path>
       </paths>
     </monitor>
   </contentMonitoring>

|

See :ref:`content-monitoring` for more information on configuring content monitoring.

.. _project-config-protected-folders:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Protected Folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The protected folders settings allows you to configure paths that can't be deleted, renamed or moved in addition to
the following paths that are protected by default:

- ``/site/website/index.xml``
- ``/site/components``
- ``/site/taxonomy``
- ``/static-assets``
- ``/templates``
- ``/scripts``
- ``/sources``

To add protected folder/s in your project, add your folder path/s like below:

.. code-block:: xml

   <protected-folders-patterns>
     <pattern>/YOUR/FOLDER/PATH/PATTERN</pattern>
     <pattern>/MORE/FOLDER/PATH/PATTERN</pattern>
     ...
   </protected-folders-patterns>

|

Remember to replace ``/YOUR/FOLDER/PATH/PATTERN`` and ``/MORE/FOLDER/PATH/PATTERN`` with the actual folder path
pattern/s that you would like to be protected.

To see an example of configured protected folders, create a project using the ``Video Center`` blueprint from the
Public Marketplace in the ``Create Project`` dialog then open the
``Sidebar`` -> |projectTools| -> ``Configuration`` -> ``Project Configuration``. Scroll down to the
``<protected-folders-patterns>`` tag:

.. code-block:: xml

   <!--
   Prevent deleting, renaming or cutting root folders of sidebar
   -->
   <protected-folders-patterns>
     <pattern>/site/streams</pattern>
     <pattern>/site/videos</pattern>
     <pattern>/site/origins</pattern>
   </protected-folders-patterns>

.. _user-interface-configuration:

""""""""""""""""
UI Configuration
""""""""""""""""
Crafter Studio's UI is highly configurable and allows you to customize the look and feel of the UI per project to suit
your needs.

The user interface configuration file defines the widgets shown in the user interface. It allows the user to
configure the items available for interaction in Studio.

It shows different projections of the content in addition to other tools to assist in content authoring
and site administration.

The UI is made up of configurable widgets and can be extended or modified by adding/removing/configuring widgets.
Plugins can make use of this by adding themselves to the UI where required. See :ref:`CrafterCMS Plugin Descriptor <plugin-descriptor-file>` for more information on how a plugin can be wired in the user interface configuration.

Here's a screenshot of Studio showing some of the widgets in the UI in red circles that are defined in the user interface configuration.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Widget Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Limiting who can access a widget via roles is through ``permittedRoles`` in the user interface configuration.
Simply add the following to the widget you want available only to users with the permitted role(s)

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

   <permittedRoles>
     <role>ALLOWED_ROLE</role>
     ...

where ALLOWED ROLE is a role defined in Studio that is allowed to access the widget. See :ref:`roles-and-permissions` for a list of default roles in Crafter Studio

Let's take a look at an example in the configuration where access to the ``Project Tools`` widget is limited to users with the roles ``admin`` and ``developer``.

SPA Sources Sidebar Cabinet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Users may want to manage (edit/view) SPA sources in their projects through Studio.
To view/edit SPA sources, simply add another ``PathNavigatorTree`` or ``PathNavigator`` widget, named ``sources``,
in the Sidebar widget like below:

.. code-block:: xml
   :caption: **SPA sources - ui.xml**
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 6-14

   <siteUI>
     <widget id="craftercms.components.ToolsPanel">
       <configuration>
         <widgets>
           ...
           <widget id="craftercms.components.PathNavigatorTree">
             <configuration>
               <id>Sources</id>
               <label>Sources</label>
               <icon id="@mui/icons-material/InsertDriveFileOutlined"/>
               <rootPath>/sources/</rootPath>
               <locale>en</locale>
             </configuration>
           </widget>
           ...


.. Note:: Adding SPA sources in top folders other than ``/sources`` is not supported.  Also note that
   items under ``/sources`` are excluded from search.

The ``Video Center`` blueprint from the marketplace contains an example of SPA sources managed in Studio
(``/sources`` added to the sidebar).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PathNavigatorTree and PathNavigator Sidebar Widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``PathNavigatorTree`` sidebar widget allows the display of trees with the ability to expand/collapse containers. It shows elements (children) in a level and allows the container children to be further expanded without navigating to the child, allowing many children to be open at the same time. Also, each container child allows filtering/searching via keywords allowing users to find items faster.

.. figure:: /_static/images/site-admin/ui-pathnavigatortree-widget.webp
   :alt: Configurations - PathNavigatorTree Widget in Sidebar

   *PathNavigatorTree widget*

The ``PathNavigator`` sidebar widget shows elements (children) of a level and allows filtering/searching via keywords allowing users to find items faster.  It doesn't provide an overview like the ``PathNavigatorTree``, but, the ``PathNavigator`` is the recommended widget if your project contains thousands of pages where a tree becomes unresponsive due to painting a massive number of items.

.. figure:: /_static/images/site-admin/ui-pathnavigator-widget.webp
   :alt: Configurations - PathNavigator Widget in Sidebar

   *PathNavigator widget*

Here are some options on displaying elements (children) of navigator widgets:

'''''
Limit
'''''
The number of children displayed at a time when expanding a container can be limited via the ``limit`` property like below:

.. code-block:: xml
    :caption: *PathNavigatorTree sidebar widget limit configuration*
    :emphasize-lines: 8

    <widget id="craftercms.components.PathNavigatorTree">
      <configuration>
        <id>StaticAssets</id>
        <label>Static Assets</label>
        <icon id="@mui/icons-material/ImageOutlined"/>
        <rootPath>/static-assets</rootPath>
        <locale>en</locale>
        <limit>5</limit>
      </configuration>
    </widget>

In the example above, the ``Static Assets`` path navigator tree limits the children displayed to 5 items when opening
a container like in the image  on the left below:

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/ui-widget-pathnavtree-limit.webp
   :alt: Configurations - User Interface Configuration PathNavigatorTree Widget Limit
   :width: 25 %

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/ui-widget-image-spacer.webp
   :width: 5 %

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/ui-widget-pathnavtree-limit-more.webp
   :alt: Configurations - User Interface Configuration PathNavigatorTree Widget Limit Expanded
   :width: 25 %


Notice also that when the user clicks on ``10 more items`` displayed on the image on the left, an additional 5 more
items will be displayed as shown on the image on the right.

Remember to do a refresh of your browser after making the limit changes and saving your configuration in order to see
the changes you've made in action.

'''''''
Sorting
'''''''
The order of children displayed may be sorted via the ``sortStrategy`` and ``order`` property like below:

.. code-block:: xml
    :caption: *Sidebar Widget Sorting Configuration Example*
    :emphasize-lines: 8-9

    <widget id="craftercms.components.PathNavigatorTree">
      <configuration>
        <id>Pages</id>
        <label>Pages</label>
        <icon id="@mui/icons-material/DescriptionOutlined"/>
        <rootPath>/site/website/index.xml</rootPath>
        <locale>en</locale>
        <sortStrategy>lastUpdate</sortStrategy>
        <order>DESC</order>
      </configuration>
    </widget>

The following ``sortStrategy`` property options are available:

- ``alphabetical``: sort in alphabetical order
- ``foldersFirst``: sort in alphabetical order, listing folders first
- ``lastUpdate``: sort using the last modified date

The following ``order`` property options are available:

- ``ASC``: display children in ascending order
- ``DESC``: display children in descending order

In the example configuration above, the children of the ``Pages`` folder will be sorted using the last modified
date in descending order. Let's take a look on how the example configuration above affects the order of children
displayed in the ``Pages`` folder.  The image on the left is a baseline screenshot of the ``/articles/2021/3`` folder
under ``Pages`` for our example. The image on the right is a screenshot of the the same folder after editing and saving
changes to the ``Top Books For Young Women`` article, where we expect our edited article to be the first one listed:

RTE
~~~
Rich Text Editors (RTEs) allow the users to edit, arrange and style content however they like, without needing to know HTML.
There are two ways of editing content in Studio: (1) form-based editing and (2) In-context editing (ICE). Form-based editing is done by clicking on ``Options`` (three dots next to the preview address bar at the top of the page, or the three dots next to the page in the Sidebar), then selecting ``Edit``. In-context editing is done by enabling the ``Edit mode`` by clicking on the pencil at the top right of the page (which turns green when enabled), then clicking on the section of the page you want to edit.

To configure the RTE, add/edit the widget ``craftercms.components.TinyMCE``:

RTE Configuration
"""""""""""""""""
Rich Text Editors (RTEs) are more effective/productive for authors when they are configured properly for the specific type of content the
author is managing. A properly and effectively configured RTE has the right styles, menu options and so on.
Every RTE in the system can have a different look and feel, different editing/menu options, available styles, components
and other configurations. You can also SHARE setups between similar RTEs in your project.

This section describes how to configure various configuration options and plugins for the RTE in the :ref:`User Interface Configuration <user-interface-configuration>` file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Common Configurations for Effective RTEs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here are some things to consider for setting up effective RTEs:

#. The rich text editor's width should be set to the same width as the region it is intended to edit
#. Project style sheet of your project is imported so it can be applied to the RTE
#. Project styles are being applied appropriately to the markup in the RTE. Note that sometimes styles in CSS are so aggressively specified that the RTE cannot pick them up.
#. Formats and styles are configured to match the part of the project being edited
#. Toolbar is configured with only what is required for the specific use case (reducing options makes it easier for editors)
#. If plugins like ``insert layout`` and so on are enabled it should be fully configured.

Crafter Studio uses standard TinyMCE plugins. To see the list of TinyMCE plugins available in Studio,
look for  ``plugins`` in the configuration:

.. |rteMediaBtn| image:: /_static/images/site-admin/rte/rte-media-button.webp
                   :width: 4%

To add TinyMCE buttons to the toolbar, add the names listed in the **toolbar** tag in the TinyMCE plugin documentation to ``toolbar(n)`` in the configuration.

Crafter Studio by default adds plugins to ``toolbar1`` as seen in the example below.

.. code-block:: xml

   ...
   "toolbar1": "formatselect | bold italic strikethrough forecolor backcolor | link | alignleft aligncenter alignright alignjustify | numlist bullist outdent indent | removeformat | editform",
   ...

|

See https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/toolbar-configuration-options/#toolbarn for more information on the toolbar(n) option of Tiny MCE


TinyMCE Plugin Toolbar Example
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Let's take a look at an example of using one of the TinyMCE plugins to add a button in the toolbar.

We'll add a media button to our editor instance to be able to embed a YouTube video:

1. Open the RTE configuration file in Studio by opening the **Sidebar**, then click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *User Interface Configuration*
2. Add ``toolbar2`` and the button name **media** like below:

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/SITENAME/sandbox/config/studio/ui.xml*
      :emphasize-lines: 2

      "toolbar1": "formatselect | bold italic strikethrough forecolor backcolor | link | alignleft aligncenter alignright alignjustify | numlist bullist outdent indent | removeformat",
      "toolbar2": "media",

   An **Insert/Edit Embedded Media** button |rteMediaBtn| will now be available for users of the RTE.

      :alt: RTE Setup - Media button added to editor instance
      :width: 75%
      :align: center

   |

2. Click on the |rteMediaBtn| button to add the link to the YouTube video you'd like to embed in the RTE and to setup other parameters. In the **General** tab, fill in the **Source** field with the URL of the YouTube video you'd like to embed and finally, fill in the **Dimensions** field to the size desired. Click on the **Ok** button.

.. _rte-configuration-tinymce-plugin-template-example:

TinyMCE Plugin Template Example
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Let's take a look at another example of using the TinyMCE plugin, ``template``.

The ``template`` plugin adds support for custom templates. The default editor instance only adds the menu item ``Insert template...`` under the ``Insert`` menu in the menubar. On TinyMCE, it adds a menu item ``Insert template`` under the ``Insert`` menu and a toolbar button.

Note that the open-source ``template`` plugin and associated config options have been removed in TinyMCE 7. To achieve
an equivalent TinyMCE config before the version 7 upgrade, the ``insert`` menu needs to be added/customised to the config as shown below:

.. code-block:: xml
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    "menu": {
      "tools": { "title": "Tools", "items": "tinymcespellchecker code acecode wordcount" },
      "insert": { "title": "Insert", "items": "image link media template codesample inserttable | charmap hr | pagebreak nonbreaking anchor | insertdatetime" }
    },

To add a template to the RTE, simply add ``templates`` under ``setup`` in the RTE configuration.
Under ``templates``, add ``title``, ``description`` and ``content``

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:
   :force:
   :emphasize-lines: 12,14-20

Let us take a look at an example of adding two templates to the RTE configuration

1. Open the RTE configuration file in your project by opening the **Sidebar**, then click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *User Interface Configuration*

2. Scroll down to the TinyMCE section and add in the following templates under ``<setup />``:

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/SITENAME/sandbox/config/studio/ui.xml*
      :linenos:

      "templates" : [
        {
          "title": "Test template 1",
          "content": "Test 1",
          "description": "Test1 Description "
        },
        {
          "title": "Test template 2",
          "content": "<div class='test'><h1>This is a title</h1><p>Look at this paragraph!</p></div>",
          "description": "Test 2 description"
        }
      ]

   |

3. Save your changes. The configured templates should now be available under ``Insert templates`` of the ``Insert`` menu.

See https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/template/ for more information on the template plugin.

.. _rte-paste-plugin-hooks:

TinyMCE paste plugin callback hooks
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The TinyMCE ``paste`` plugin enables you to modify the pasted content before it gets inserted into the editor (``paste_preprocess``) and before it gets inserted into the editor but after it’s been parsed into a DOM structure (``paste_postprocess``). For more information on these options, see https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/copy-and-paste/#paste_preprocess.

In order to hook into the callback (``paste_preprocess`` and ``paste_postprocess``), do the following in the RTE configuration:

1) Add the default ``paste`` plugin in ``plugins`` if not already included

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/SITENAME/sandbox/config/studio/ui.xml*

      "plugins": "print preview searchreplace autolink directionality visualblocks visualchars fullscreen image link media template codesample table charmap hr pagebreak nonbreaking anchor toc insertdatetime advlist lists wordcount textpattern help acecode paste"

   |

2) Create an :ref:`external plugin <adding-external-plugins>` by following the structure of the example plugin `here <https://github.com/craftercms/studio-ui/blob/develop/static-assets/js/tinymce-plugins/craftercms_paste_extension/craftercms_tinymce_hooks.sample.js>`__. To modify the pasted content, add your code under ``paste_preprocess()`` or ``paste_postprocess()`` depending on your needs.

3) Add the plugin created in the previous step as an external plugin under the ``craftercms_tinymce_hooks`` tag.

   .. code-block:: xml
      :force:
      :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/SITENAME/sandbox/config/studio/ui.xml*

      "external_plugins": {
        "craftercms_tinymce_hooks": "/studio/1/plugin/file?siteId={site}&pluginId=craftercms&type=tinymce&name=craftercms_paste_extension&filename=samplepasteplugin.js"
      }

   |

   For more information on ``craftercms_tinymce_hooks``, see :ref:`here <extending-tinymce>`

.. note::
   When Tiny's ``paste`` plugin is included, ``craftercms_paste_cleanup`` extension is also enabled. CrafterCMS' extension performs some additional paste cleanup from what Tiny's plugin does. To disable these additional processing of the paste input, you may add ``<craftercms_paste_cleanup>false</craftercms_paste_cleanup>`` to the RTE configuration


.. _rte-add-allowable-elements:

'''''''''''''''''''''''''
Adding Allowable Elements
'''''''''''''''''''''''''
Tiny MCE allows only a certain set of elements (HTML tags) as valid (rule set) by default in the code editor and will strip elements not in the allowable list  when it outputs its HTML. For example, if you try adding in the ``<script />`` element , or the ``<iframe />`` element, it will be stripped out of the HTML output. To add specific elements that should also be valid, in addition to the existing rule set, we use the ``extended_valid_elements`` in the RTE configuration. Simply add the elements you would like added to the existing rule set in the ``<extended_valid_elements />`` tag in RTE Configuration file.

.. code-block:: xml

   "extended_valid_elements": "script mycustomtag",   <!-- elements whitelist (won't be stripped out) -->

|

Example allowing script element
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Let's take a look at an example of adding ``<script />`` to the allowable elements (rule set). We'll be using a project created using the Website Editorial blueprint.

1. Open the RTE configuration file in Studio by opening the **Sidebar**, then click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *User Interface Configuration* then scroll down to the ``craftercms.components.TinyMCE`` widget section

2. Scroll down to ``extended_valid_elements`` and add ``script`` and save.

   .. code-block:: xml

      "extended_valid_elements": "script"   <!-- elements whitelist (won't be stripped out) -->

   |

3. We'll now add ``<script />`` in the RTE to verify it works.

   Open the **Sidebar** and edit one of the articles. Navigate to ``/articles/2020/7/`` then right click on ``New ACME Phone Released Today`` and select ``Edit``.

   Scroll down to the ``Content`` part of the form and Under ``Sections``, click on ``Add Another``

4. Click on the newly added section, then click on ``Tools`` -> ``Code Editor`` from the RTE menubar.

   .. figure:: /_static/images/site-admin/rte/rte-open-code-editor.webp
      :alt: RTE Setup - Open RTE code editor
      :width: 85%
      :align: center

   |

5. Add a script in the code editor then save the changes. This will display a dialog saying ``Hello`` when you preview the article ``New ACME Phone Released Today``

   .. code-block:: html

      <script>alert('Hello!')</script>

   |

6. Preview the page. A dialog saying ``Hello`` should pop up before the page is displayed

   |

   Please note that TinyMCE gives this warning when allowing script elements (<script />):

   .. Warning:: Allowing script elements (<script>) in TinyMCE exposes users to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.


Example allowing a custom element
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
You can also add custom elements to the rule set and can be done by simply adding the custom tag to ``extended_valid_elements``. Let's take a look at an example of adding the tag  ``mycustomtag`` to the rule set.

.. note:: Case sensitive custom elements are not supported in TinyMCE 5. Remember to **use only lowercase for custom elements** (e.g. ``myattr`` is supported but *myAttr* is not supported).

1. Open the RTE configuration file in Studio by opening the **Sidebar**, then click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *User Interface Configuration* then scroll down to the ``craftercms.components.TinyMCE`` widget section

2. Scroll down to ``extended_valid_elements``  and add ``mycustomtag`` and save.

   .. code-block:: xml

      "extended_valid_elements": [ "script", "mycustomtag"]

   |

3. We'll now add the ``<mycustomtag />`` in the RTE to verify it works.

   Open the **Sidebar** and edit one of the articles. Navigate to ``/articles/2020/7/`` then right click on ``New ACME Phone Released Today`` and select ``Edit``.

   Scroll down to the ``Content`` part of the form and Under ``Sections``, click on one of the section, then click on ``Tools`` -> ``Code Editor`` from the RTE menubar, then use  ``<mycustomtag />``

.. _adding-external-plugins:

'''''''''''''''''''''''
Adding External Plugins
'''''''''''''''''''''''
TinyMCE provides an option to specify URLS to plugins outside the tinymce plugins directory. These external plugins allow the user to extend TinyMCE. For example, you can create custom dialogs, buttons, menu items, etc.

For more information on the Tiny MCE external_plugins option, see https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/editor-important-options/#external_plugins

The Crafter Studio developer does not have full control of the tinymce initialization. To add a custom button to the toolbar in Crafter Studio, it would be done using the external plugin route since, what TinyMCE docs advise – i.e. using the ``setup`` function to add the button – is not viable in Studio without creating a :ref:`form control plugin <building-plugins-controls>` where they'd have full control of tinymce initialization.

To add an external plugin, use ``external_plugins`` in the RTE configuration.
Use the Crafter Studio API that gets a file for a given plugin, the getPluginFile API found here :base_url:`getPluginFile <_static/api/studio.html#tag/plugin/operation/getPluginFile>` to get the Tiny MCE external plugin file to pass to the RTE.

Example External Plugin
'''''''''''''''''''''''
Let's take a look at an example of a simple external plugin that creates a custom button which inserts text in the RTE.
We'll load our external plugin (a custom button) and add it to the RTE's toolbar. For our example, we'll be using a site created using the empty blueprint named ``hello``.

1. Open the RTE configuration file in Studio by opening the **Sidebar**, then click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *User Interface Configuration* then scroll down to the ``craftercms.components.TinyMCE`` widget section

2. We'll add the configuration for TinyMCE to load the plugin using Crafter Studio's getPluginFile API. We achieve this by using  ``external_plugins`` and adding child tags with the id of the plugin as tag name and the target URL as the tag's content |br|

   .. code-block:: xml
      :force:

      "external_plugins": {
        "my_button": "/studio/1/plugin/file?siteId={site}&pluginId=my_button&type=tinymce&name=my_button&filename=plugin.js"
      }

   |

   where:

      {site}: a macro that inserts the current siteId


3. Add the custom button we're creating to the toolbar of the RTE. Scroll to the ``toolbar(n)`` tag and add the custom button we are creating ``my_button`` to ``toolbar2``

   .. code-block:: xml

      "toolbar2": "my_button"

   |

4. Finally, we'll create our plugin file and add it in to Studio. See :ref:`plugins` for more information on creating a Crafter Studio plugin.

   * Using information from step 2 for our external plugin, create the required directory structure for the plugin file, then create our plugin file named ``plugin.js``

     .. code-block:: js
        :linenos:
        :caption: *$CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/SITE_NAME/sandbox/config/studio/plugins/tinymce/my_button/plugin.js*

        (function () {

          'use strict';

          tinymce.PluginManager.add("my_button", function (editor, url) {

            function _onAction()
            {
              // Write something in the RTE when the plugin is triggered
              editor.insertContent("<p>Content added from my button.</p>")
            }

            // Define the Toolbar button
            editor.ui.registry.addButton('my_button', {
                text: "My Button",
                onAction: _onAction
            });
          });

          // Return details to be displayed in TinyMCE's "Help" plugin, if you use it
          // This is optional.
          return {
            getMetadata: function () {
              return {
                name: "My Button example",
                url: "http://exampleplugindocsurl.com"
              };
            }
          };
        })();

     |

     We recommend minimizing the ``plugin.js`` file. If your plugin is minimized, remember to change the external_plugins > my_button URL in the RTE configuration to load the minified version.

   * Remember to commit the new file so Studio will pick it up by doing a ``git add`` then a ``git commit``. Whenever you edit directly in the filesystem, you need to commit your changes to ensure they are properly reflected.

5. Let's see the TinyMCE external plugin we created in action.

   Edit the ``Home`` page by opening the ``Sidebar`` then under ``Pages``, right-click on ``Home``, then select edit. |br|
   Scroll down to the ``Main Content`` section of the form to view the RTE. Notice that the button we created is in the toolbar.

   |

   Click on our custom button in the RTE ``My Button``, and the line *Content added from my button.* will be inserted into the RTE

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Adding support for valid child elements within a parent element
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
TinyMCE provides an option to control what child elements can exist within specified parent elements.
By adding/removing child elements that can exist within a parent element, you can force which elements are valid children of the parent element.

To add/remove child elements to the list of valid child elements, add/remove the element in the **valid_children** tag in the RTE Configuration file. To add a child element to a parent element, use a ``+`` before the parent element then enclose in square brackets the child element/s you want to add e.g. ``+a[div|p]``. To remove a child element, use a ``-`` before the parent element then enclose in square brackets the child element/s you want to remove,  e.g. ``-a[img]``. You can add multiple parent elements by using a comma separated list of parents with elements that should be added/removed as valid children

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *Example adding/removing elements for the specified parent*

      "valid_children" : "+body[style],-body[div],p[strong|a|#text]"

   |

The example above shows you how to add **style** as a valid child of **body** and remove **div** as a valid child. It also forces only *strong* and **a** and *text contents* to be valid children of **p**.


For more information on the TinyMCE ``valid_children`` option, see https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/content-filtering/#valid_children

Example adding valid child elements to parent element
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Let's take a look at an example of how to add **div** and *text content* as valid children of **a** (html anchor) using the website editorial blueprint.

1. Open the RTE configuration file in Studio by opening the **Sidebar**, then click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *User Interface Configuration* then scroll down to the ``craftercms.components.TinyMCE`` widget section

2. Add ``valid_children`` and add **div** and text contents as child elements of **a** and save.

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *RTE Configuration File*

      "valid_children": "+a[div|#text]"

   |

3. We'll now disable ``Force Root Block p Tag`` and ``Force p tags New Lines`` so that markup we enter in the RTE code editor will remain unchanged after saving your changes. Setting the ``Force Root Block p Tag``  option to false will never produce **p** tags on enter, or, automatically it will instead produce **br** elements and Shift+Enter will produce a **p**.

   Open the *Article* content type by opening the **Sidebar**, then click on |projectTools| -> *Content Types* -> *Article* -> *Open Type*.
   Scroll down to the ``Sections Repeating Group`` field, then click on the ``section_html`` field, which is an RTE.

   In the ``Properties Explorer`` on the right, remove the check mark on the property ``Force Root Block p Tag`` and ``Force p tags New Lines``.

4. We'll now add markup in the RTE to test that **div** is now allowed to be a child element (nested) of parent element **a**.

   Open the **Sidebar** then click on *Site Explorer* and edit one of the articles. Navigate to ``/articles/2020/7/`` then right click on ``New ACME Phone Released Today`` and select ``Edit``.

   Scroll down to the ``Content`` part of the form and under ``Sections``, click on ``Add Another``.

   Click on the newly added section, then click on ``Tools`` -> ``Code Editor`` from the RTE menubar, then add the following:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <a href="#">
        <div class="nesting_test_div">
          <img src="/static-assets/images/castle-pic.jpg" alt="" />
          <div class="nesting_test" title="Testing nesting elements">This is a test for nesting elements</div>
        </div>
      </a>

   |

   After saving your changes, preview the page and it should now display an image and text that's a link. Re-open the RTE code editor and verify that the markup you inputted is unchanged.

Inserting Links to Pages in the Rich Text Editor (RTE)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Users sometimes need to link to a page in the site to selected text in their document.
This section details how to setup the Rich Text Editor (RTE) to allow a user to browse or search for pages and insert links to them.

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Basic Setup and Configuration
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
#. Open the content type with the Rich Text Editor (RTE) to be setup. Open the **Sidebar** and click on |projectTools| and select **Content Types**. Select the content type with the RTE you'd like to setup, then click on the **Open Type** button.
#. Setup the data source to select a page from the site. From the content model definition, go to the **Data Sources** panel and drag ``File Browse`` to the the ``Data Sources`` section of the form and fill in the following properties:

   * Title : Data source title to show on the form e.g. ``Pages``
   * Name : Name of variable to store the final result in e.g. ``pages``
   * Repository Path : Path where to browse the pages from e.g. ``/site/website``

#. Bind the data source setup above to the RTE. From the content model definition, click on the RTE you want to be able to browse or search for pages and insert links to them. Next, go to the **Properties Explorer** panel and scroll to the ``File Manager`` property. Put a check mark on the box next to the data source previously setup to bind it to the RTE.

#. Click on the **Save** button to save your changes. The RTE is now setup to allow a user to browse or search for pages and insert links to them.

'''''''
Example
'''''''
Let's take a look at an example using a site created using the ``Website Editorial`` blueprint. We will setup the RTE in the ``Article`` content type to allow a user to browse or search for pages and insert links to them. We will first setup the RTE, then see it in action.

#. Open the content type with the Rich Text Editor (RTE) to be setup. Open the **Sidebar** and click on |projectTools| and select **Content Types**. Click on **Open Existing Type**, and select the content type ``Article`` then click on the **Open Type** button.

#. Setup the data source to select a page from the site. From the content model definition, go to the **Data Sources** panel and drag ``File Browse`` to the ``Data Sources`` section of the form.

Templates
'''''''''
Templates are used for the email messages sent for workflow states in the configuration file mentioned above. The template used is Freemarker (also known as FTL).
Variables are referenced in the template like `${VARIABLE}` or as part of a Freemarker statement like `<#list files as file>...</#list>`
Dates can be formatted like so: `scheduleDate?string["MMMMM dd, yyyy 'at' hh:mm a"]}`

A full guide to FTL can be found here: http://freemarker.org/

Where:

- **studio.monitoring.disk.highWaterMark**: The disk utilization percentage level that triggers an action to perform
  ``git gc``, then the low watermark threshold is checked after, which determines whether an alarm is set.
- **studio.monitoring.disk.lowWaterMark**: The disk utilization percentage level that triggers the low disk space alarm.
  Once the low disk space alarm is set, it gets cleared when the disk utilization percentage goes below the low watermark.
  Note that the low watermark value **must be less than the high watermark value**.
- **studio.monitoring.disk.cron**: The cron expression for scheduling how often disk utilization is checked against the
  configured thresholds (high and low watermark).
- **studio.monitoring.disk.notifications.webhook.method**: The webhook HTTP request method (verb), e.g. POST, PUT, GET, etc.
- **studio.monitoring.disk.notifications.email.template**: The template used for sending the alarm state email
  Note also that emails are sent using the email in ``studio.mail.from.default`` as the from address.
  See :ref:`studio-smtp-config` for more information on configuring the mail client to send emails from Crafter Studio.
- **studio.monitoring.disk.notifications.webhook.template**:
  The default built-in template for webhook notification in ``studio.monitoring.disk.notifications.webhook.template``
  works for `slack <https://slack.com>`_. If you wish to change the webhook response, simply add your customized templates
  to ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension``.

To change the default templates (webhook template or email template) to a custom one, simply add your customized
templates to ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension``.

For example, we have a custom webhook template ``my-disk-monitor-alarm.ftl`` that we will now place under
``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/my-disk-monitor-alarm.ftl``
that we want to use instead of the default. We'll now configure Studio to use our custom template by modifying the
``studio.monitoring.disk.notifications.webhook.template`` value in the Studio configuration override file:

.. code-block::

CrafterCMS allows the creation of a publishing blacklist to prevent certain unwanted items from being published.

A comma-separated list of regexes is used to configure items that should not be published.

To configure the publishing blacklist, using your favorite editor open ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml`` or open the Global Studio Configuration Override file **studio-config-override.yaml** located under ``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/global/configuration`` that can be accessed from Studio from the ``Main Menu`` under ``Global Config``.

Add the following lines with the regex for the item you wish not to be published. By default, ``.keep`` files are not published by CrafterCMS. Just add a ``,`` then your regex after ``.*/\.keep``:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: *studio-config-override.yaml*

    # Publishing blacklist configuration, items matching regexes on this list will never be published
    studio.configuration.publishing.blacklist.regex: >-
        .*/\.keep

|

Items in the publishing blacklist will not be published but will instead be marked as published and logged (debug level) in the tomcat log, why the item was not published.

.. code-block:: text

    [DEBUG] 2021-04-22T08:16:01,023 [studio.clockTaskExecutor-42] [deployment.PublishingManagerImpl] | File /static-assets/css/.keep of the site mysite will not be published because it matches the configured publishing blacklist regex patterns.

~~~~~~~
Example
~~~~~~~
Let's take a look at an example.

Create a site using the website editorial blueprint, then create the folder ``mytempimages`` under ``/static-assets/images``.

Say, you do not want files under ``/static-assets/images/mytempimages`` to be published when a user performs a bulk publish or *Approve & Publish* of multiple items from the dashboard. We'll add to the ``studio.configuration.publishing.blacklist.regex`` the regex for items under ``/static-assets/images/mytempimages``

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: *studio-config-override.yaml*

    # Publishing blacklist configuration, items matching regexes on this list will never be published
    studio.configuration.publishing.blacklist.regex: >-
        .*/\.keep,\/static-assets\/images\/mytempimages\/.*

|

Save your changes and restart Studio.

Upload an image under ``/static-assets/images/mytempimages``

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/studio/publishing-blacklist-example.webp
   :alt: System Administrator - Publishing blacklist example file uploaded that will not be published"
   :width: 30 %
   :align: center

Publish the uploaded image by right-clicking on the image, then select **Approve & Publish**. The **Approve for Publish** dialog will open up. Select **Items should be published now**, then click on the **Submit** button.

After publishing, open the **Sidebar** again and navigate to ``/static-assets/images/mytempimages``. Notice that your file has been marked published.

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/studio/publishing-blacklist-example-published.webp
   :alt: System Administrator - Publishing blacklist example file published"
   :width: 45 %
   :align: center

Let's take a look at the tomcat log, notice that it was logged that the file we uploaded will not be published because it is in the publishing blacklist:

To configure the ``git gc`` options prune expire and auto pack limit, set the following properties:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/global/configuration/studio-config-override.yaml*
    :emphasize-lines: 5,7

    # git gc --auto will consolidate into one the packs older than this value
    # Notice that this property works when the number of packs is greater than gc.autoPackLimit.

    # This value is used to configure "gc.prunePackExpire" property, leave empty to skip property setting
    studio.repo.gc.prunePackExpire: 1.hour.ago
    # Set global gc.autoPackLimit property
    studio.repo.gc.autoPackLimit: 50

where:

- **studio.repo.gc.prunePackExpire**: This maps to Git's "gc.pruneExpire". Unreachable objects older than this value
  are pruned when running ``git gc``. Example values accepted are: ``1.hour.ago``, ``2.weeks.ago`` , ``now``, or ``never``.
  See `Prune expire <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-gcpruneExpire>`__ in the Git docs
  for valid values for the option.

- **studio.repo.gc.autoPackLimit**: This maps to Git's "gc.autoPackLimit". Packs are consolidated when the number
  of packs exceeds the value in this property.
  See `Auto pack limit <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-gcautoPackLimit>`__ in the Git
  docs for valid values for the option.

These properties are configured on Studio startup as git global properties. Values configured are just passed to git.
Remember that you need to restart Studio for the changes you make to the above properties to take effect.

.. important::
    The ``studio.repo.git.global.update.enabled`` property allows you to opt-out of the git config update.
    Note the importance of disabling this property for local developer deployment since it's a global change
    of Git's default behavior and may affect unintended repositories.

Soft dependencies are referenced items that are in a modified state and are optional. When calculating soft
dependencies, CrafterCMS follows dependencies recursively. To set the depth of soft dependencies calculated, configure
the maximum recursion iterations property ``studio.db.maxRecursiveIterations`` with a value between 0 and 20.
The default value is 10.

To set up a Studio environment, do the following:

#. Create a folder under ``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/${site}/sandbox/config/studio`` called ``env``
#. Inside the folder, create a directory called ``myenv`` (or whatever you want to call the environment)
#. Copy the configuration file you want to override in the new environment you are setting up, inside your ``myenv`` folder
   following the folder structure under ``config/studio``.
#. Remember to commit the files copied so Studio will pick it up.
#. In the ``crafter-setenv.sh`` file in ``TOMCAT/bin`` set the
   following property to desired environment:

To configure access to Crafter Studio beyond adding groups and users, you'll need to configure the system-wide configuration files:

.. _global-role-mappings-config:

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Global Role Mappings Config
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The global role mappings configuration file maps user :ref:`groups <groups-management>` to one or more roles and serves
as the base for every project in your CrafterCMS installation. All role mappings configured here are in addition to what
is configured in the project role mappings.

Role mappings per project are managed within Crafter Studio's UI. See :ref:`project-role-mappings` for more information.

To access the global role mappings config file, using your favorite editor, navigate to ``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/global/configuration/``
then open the file ``global-role-mappings-config.xml``. Remember to restart Crafter so your changes to the file will take effect.

Here's the default global role mappings configuration (click on the triangle on the left to expand/collapse):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default Global Role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CrafterCMS comes with a predefined global role ``system_admin`` out of the box.

Users with the ``system_admin`` role have access to everything in the CMS such as all the modules in the Main Menu for managing users, groups, etc., all the sites and configuration files, creating/editing layouts, templates, taxonomies, content types, scripts, etc. in addition to creating and editing content, as well as the ability to approve and reject workflow.

See :ref:`global-permission-mappings-config` for more information on all items accessible for the ``system_admin`` role.

.. _studio-security:

--------
Security
--------
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users are authenticated by Studio through the internal database by default. CrafterCMS can be configured so that users are authenticated using an external authentication protocol such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), or integrate with any Single-Sign-On (SSO) solution that can provide headers to Studio to indicate successful authentication.

Here's a list of security providers supported by CrafterCMS for accessing the repository:

- :ref:`Studio SAML security <crafter-studio-configure-studio-saml>` |enterpriseOnly|
- :ref:`Header-Based (use when authenticating via headers) <crafter-studio-configure-header-based-auth>` |enterpriseOnly|
- :ref:`LDAP (users are imported from LDAP into the database) <crafter-studio-configure-ldap>` |enterpriseOnly|
- Internal database (users are stored in database)

To configure an external authentication method, please follow one of the guides below:

When using an external authentication method, user accounts are automatically created in the internal database upon each user's first successful login, using the attributes from the responses received. Users added to the internal database after the user's first successful login through external authentication are marked as **Externally Managed**.

.. _configure-authentication-chain:

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Configure Authentication Chain
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
CrafterCMS supports multiple security providers and allows configuration of multiple authentication providers in a chain that are then iterated through until either the user is authenticated and granted access or authentication fails and an HTTP 401 Unauthorized is returned to the user. This allows Studio to support multiple security providers that appears like a single authentication module to users.

The following authentication providers can be configured in a chain:

    - Headers
    - LDAP
    - Internal database

.. note:: SAML2 authentication cannot be configured in a chain. SAML2 authentication is a standalone authentication provider.

When an authentication chain is configured when a user logs in, Studio will try to authenticate the user using the first security provider in the chain as defined in the ``studio-config-override.yaml`` file. If authentication fails, it will then move on to the next authentication provider in the list and try to authenticate the user again. It will continue moving on to the next security provider in the chain until the user is authenticated or the authentication fails.

To set up the authentication chain, open the file ``studio-config-override.yaml`` under ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension``. Another way to access the ``studio-config-override.yaml`` file is by clicking on the |mainMenu| **Navigation Menu** from the context nav in Studio, then clicking on ``Global Config``.

Below is a sample configuration for the authentication chain. There are four authentication providers in the example below: (1) Headers Authentication, (2) LDAP1, (3) LDAP2 (4) Internal Database.

In the configuration above, when a user tries to authenticate, the user's credentials will be passed first to the headers authentication provider. If the authentication succeeds, the processing in the chain is done and the user is allowed to proceed. If the authentication fails, the user credentials will then be passed to LDAP1. If authentication is successful, processing in the chain is done, otherwise, the user credentials are then passed on to LDAP2. LDAP2 will then try to authenticate user. If successful, processing in the chain is done, otherwise, the user credentials are then passed to the final provider in the chain, the internal database. The final provider in the chain then determines whether the user is successfully authenticated or rejected and sent an HTTP 401 Unauthorized message. Below is a diagram showing the authentication chain process using the above configuration:

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. version_tag::
	:label: Since
	:version: 4.0.3

Crafter Studio can be configured to support SAML2 SSO out of the box without using any additional plugins.

.. important::
   *This document only applies to* **CrafterCMS version 4.0.3 and later** |br|
   *Please see* :ref:`here <crafter-studio-configure-studio-saml-up-to-4-0-2>` *for version 4.0.2 and earlier.*

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. A SAML2-compatible Identity Provider (IdP) properly configured; this configuration will not be covered here
#. A private key and certificate. This can be generated like so:

    ``openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout rp-private.key -x509 -days 365 -out rp-certificate.crt``

    Take note of the values of the following options used to generate your key and certificate that will be used later for configuring Studio:

    * **keyout**: The value used for this option wil be used in the ``studio.security.saml.rp.privateKey.location`` property
    * **out**: The value used for this option will be used in the ``studio.security.saml.rp.certificate.location`` property

.. note::
   ``IdP`` is the asserting party and ``SP`` is the relying party (Studio)

~~~~~~~~~
Configure
~~~~~~~~~
To configure Studio SAML2, in your Authoring installation, we need to enable SAML security then we'll setup the required SAML configuration properties.

To enable SAML security, go to ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin``, open the ``crafter-setenv.sh`` file, and uncomment the line ``export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=crafter.studio.samlSecurity``:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/crafter-setenv.sh*

   # -------------------- Spring Profiles --------------------
   ...
   # Uncomment to enable Crafter Studio SAML2 security
   export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=crafter.studio.samlSecurity
   # For multiple active spring profiles, create comma separated list

|

Next, we'll set up SAML configuration properties. Go to ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension`` and add/uncomment the following lines to ``studio-config-override.yaml`` (of course, make any appropriate configuration changes according to your system):

Configure Header-Based Authentication |enterpriseOnly|
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Crafter Studio can integrate with any authentication system that sends custom HTTP headers containing information that will be used to authenticate the user in Studio. This section details how to set up Studio for header-based authentication.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configure Studio for Header-Based Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configuring Studio for header-based authentication is very simple: in your Authoring installation, go to ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension`` and add the following lines to ``studio-config-override.yaml`` (of course, make any appropriate configuration changes according to your system):

.. code-block:: properties

    # Studio authentication chain configuration
    # studio.authentication.chain:
      # Authentication provider type
      # - provider: HEADERS
        # Authentication via headers enabled
        # enabled: true
        # Authentication header for secure key
        # secureKeyHeader: secure_key
        # Authentication headers secure key that is expected to match secure key value from headers
        # Typically this is placed in the header by the authentication agent
        # secureKeyHeaderValue: secure
        # Authentication header for username
        # usernameHeader: username
        # Authentication header for first name
        # firstNameHeader: firstname
        # Authentication header for last name
        # lastNameHeader: lastname
        # Authentication header for email
        # emailHeader: email
        # Authentication header for groups: comma separated list of sites and groups
        #   Example:
        #   site_author,site_xyz_developer
        # groupsHeader: groups
        # (Optional) All authentication header values are in this JWT header's claims.
        # jwtAuthTokenHeader: x-crafter-oidc-data
        # Enable/disable logout for headers authenticated users (SSO)
        # logoutEnabled: false
        # If logout is enabled for headers authenticated users (SSO), set the endpoint of the SP or IdP logout, which should
        # be called after local logout. The {baseUrl} macro is provided so that the browser is redirected back to Studio
        # after logout (https://STUDIO_SERVER:STUDIO_PORT/studio)
        # logoutUrl: /YOUR_DOMAIN/logout?ReturnTo={baseUrl}

The attribute ``enabled`` enables/disables headers authentication; make sure this is set to **true** for header-based authentication |br|

The ``secure_key`` attribute is a secret shared between the authentication agent and Studio via this header. Note that this ``secure_key`` is
**required** and header-based authentication will not proceed unless the ``secure_key`` sent to Studio matches this configuration.

Upon matching the ``secure_key`` header, Studio will then look for the principal. This can come in one of two formats:

#. A set of loose headers indicate the principal's attributes: ``username``, ``firstname``, ``lastname``, ``email``, and ``groups``; or
#. A JWT-wrapped principal's attributes as specified by ``x-crafter-oidc-data``

Depending on your authentication agent, configure Studio to look for either the loose attributes or JWT.

''''''''''''''''''
Configuring Logout
''''''''''''''''''
The **Sign out** button link is disabled/hidden by default when header-based authentication is enabled.

To enable **Sign out** for users signed in using header-based authentication, change the following lines (as described from the above configuration) in your ``studio-config-override.yaml`` file (of course, make any appropriate configuration changes according to your system):

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Enable/disable logout for headers authenticated users (SSO)
    # logoutEnabled: false
    # If logout is enabled for headers authenticated users (SSO), set the endpoint of the SP or IdP logout, which should
    # be called after local logout. The {baseUrl} macro is provided so that the browser is redirected back to Studio
    # after logout (https://STUDIO_SERVER:STUDIO_PORT/studio)
    # logoutUrl: /YOUR_DOMAIN/logout?ReturnTo={baseUrl}

To configure LDAP authentication, in your Authoring installation, go to ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension`` and uncomment the
following lines to the ``studio-config-override.yaml`` file.

.. note:: The values for the parameters listed below are just examples. Remember to make any appropriate configuration changes according to your directory service in use.

Some notes on the properties above:

- ``enabled`` enables/disables LDAP authentication, make sure this is set to **true** for LDAP authentication
- ``serverUrl`` is just the URL where the LDAP server is listening for requests.
- ``bindDN`` and ``bindPassword`` are basically the credentials used to connect initially to the LDAP server.
- ``baseContext`` is the LDAP tree root where the user entries can be located.
- ``username``, ``firstName``, ``lastName`` and ``email`` are basic user attributes.
- ``groupName`` indicates the groups the user belongs to (can have multiple values). You can specify a regex to extract the group name of a user.

Studio will then do a query against the LDAP server whenever a user attempts to log in and the user is not yet in the DB. If there's a match in LDAP, the user is
created in the database with the imported LDAP attributes, and finally added to the groups specified in LDAP.

Also, please note that Studio needs all the attributes listed in the config to be present in the LDAP user's attributes, otherwise, Studio is not able to authenticate the user. When an attribute is missing, an error message will be displayed in the login screen: ``A system error has occurred. Please wait a few minutes or contact an administrator``. Please look at the tomcat log to check which attribute was not found. Here's an example log:

    [WARN] 2017-10-11 12:42:57,487 [http-nio-8080-exec-2] [security.DbWithLdapExtensionSecurityProvider] | No LDAP attribute crafterGroup found for username jbloggs

|

Here are a few things to take note of when configuring LDAP authentication in Studio:

Make sure that at least one of the **groupName** attribute of the LDAP user exists in Studio and has Roles and Permission setup. If there is no **groupName** attribute setup in Studio with Roles and Permissions, please make sure that the system administrator assigns a role to at least one group in Studio so the user can access the site, otherwise, once the user gets into the **Sites** screen and tries to Preview the site or view the dashboard, the user will get a notification that the site is invalid.

CrafterCMS comes with predefined roles out of the box for projects.
Here's a list of predefined roles for projects:

* **admin**: Users with the ``admin`` role have access to project configuration files, creating/editing layouts, templates, taxonomies, content types, scripts, etc. in addition to creating and editing content, as well as the ability to approve and reject workflow

* **developer**: Users with the ``developer`` role have access to project configuration files, creating/editing layouts, templates, taxonomies, content types, scripts, etc. in addition to creating and editing content, as well as the ability to approve and reject workflow

* **reviewer**: Users with the ``reviewer`` role have the ability to approve and reject workflow. They also have access to a number of actions in the dashboard that are not available to content contributors (users with the role ``author``), including ``Pending Approval`` and ``Scheduled Publish``. They do not have access to edit content.

* **publisher**: Users with the ``publisher`` role have the ability to approve and reject workflow. They also have access to a number of actions in the dashboard that are not available to content contributors (users with the role ``author``), including ``Pending Approval`` and ``Scheduled Publish``. In addition, they also have access to create, edit, and submit content like the ``author`` role.

* **author**: Users with the role ``author`` have access to create, edit and submit content

See :ref:`permission-mappings` for more information on all items accessible for each role in a project.

.. _permission-mappings:

"""""""""""""""""""
Permission Mappings
"""""""""""""""""""
The permission mappings configuration file allows you to assign permissions to folders and objects in a project/site giving specific Roles rights to the object. The permission mappings config file contains the permissions mappings for the roles defined in the role mappings config file. When applying permissions to Roles, rights are granted by adding permissions inside the tag ``<allowed-permissions>``. The absence of permissions means the permission is denied. Rules have a regex expression that governs the scope of the permissions assigned. A list of available permissions that can be granted to Roles is available after the sample configuration file.

Permissions are defined per:
    project/site > role > rule

For example, to grant the role component_author the ability to read/write
components and read-only to everything else:

.. code-block:: xml
      :linenos:

      <role name="component_author">
        <rule regex="/site/website/.*">
          <allowed-permissions>
            <permission>content_read</permission>
          </allowed-permissions>
        </rule>
        <rule regex="/site/components/.*">
          <allowed-permissions>
            <permission>content_read</permission>
            <permission>content_write</permission>
            <permission>content_create</permission>
            <permission>folder_create</permission>
          </allowed-permissions>
        </rule>
        <rule regex="/static-assets/.*">
          <allowed-permissions>
            <permission>content_read</permission>
          </allowed-permissions>
        </rule>
      </role>

|

To modify/view the permission mappings for your project/site in Studio, click on |projectTools| at the bottom of the *Sidebar*, then click on **Configurations** and select **Permissions Mapping** from the list.

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/config-open-permission-mappings.webp

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Configure Studio Password Requirements
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Password requirements validation allows the admin to setup rules that ensures users create passwords based on an organization’s password security policy.

Crafter Studio uses `zxcvbn <https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn>`__ for password strength management.

.. version_tag::
	:label: Since
	:version: 4.0.3

|

The password strength configured here is displayed to the user when resetting a password or creating a user.

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/password-requirements.webp
   :alt: System Administrator - Password Requirements Display
   :align: center
   :width: 55%

|

To configure the password strength, click on |mainMenu| **Main Menu** then click on ``Global Config``.
Scroll to the section ``Security`` and change the value of ``studio.security.passwordRequirements.minimumComplexity``
to desired minimum password complexity required:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:
   :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/global/configuration/studio-config-override.yaml*

   # Password requirements minimum complexity
   # This is based on https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn
   # The minimum complexity corresponds to the password score
   # You can try this out here https://lowe.github.io/tryzxcvbn/
   #  score      # Integer from 0-4 (useful for implementing a strength bar)
   #  0 # too guessable: risky password. (guesses < 10^3)
   #  1 # very guessable: protection from throttled online attacks. (guesses < 10^6)
   #  2 # somewhat guessable: protection from unthrottled online attacks. (guesses < 10^8)
   #  3 # safely unguessable: moderate protection from offline slow-hash scenario. (guesses < 10^10)
   #  4 # very unguessable: strong protection from offline slow-hash scenario. (guesses >= 10^10)
   # The default value is 3
   studio.security.passwordRequirements.minimumComplexity: 3

|

Crafter Studio's default minimum password complexity required is set to 3 (which translate to a score
of 80 in the UI), and until the user setting/changing the password has met the minimum required,
the ``Submit`` button will not be enabled. Also, once the minimum password strength score has been
reached, the score will be displayed in green.

Randomize Authoring's "admin" Password for CrafterCMS Fresh Install
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
CrafterCMS gives you the option to randomize the **admin** password on a fresh install. To randomize the **admin** password, before starting CrafterCMS for the very first time, in your Authoring installation, go to  the following folder: ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/`` and add the following to the ``studio-config-override.yaml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml
       :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml*

       # Random admin password allowed chars
       studio.db.initializer.randomAdminPassword.chars: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*_=+-/

To enable the random admin password generation, just set ``studio.db.initializer.randomAdminPassword.enabled`` to ``true`` and specify your desired password length and allowed characters for the password. Save the file after making your changes.

After saving the ``studio-config-override.yaml`` file, start CrafterCMS. You'll then need to look at the authoring tomcat log, and search for the following string to get the random password generated for user **admin**: `*** Admin Account Password:`

Here's a sample password generated for the admin as listed in the Tomcat log:

    ``INFO: *** Admin Account Password: "WXOIK$O$yGixio2h" ***``

You can now log in as the user **admin** using the randomly generated password listed in the Tomcat log.

Studio Timeouts

.. _changing-session-timeout:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changing the Session Timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CrafterCMS has configurable timeouts for session lifetime and session inactivity.

Session lifetime timeout is the amount of time a session is valid before requiring the user to re-authenticate.

Session inactivity timeout is the amount of time of user inactivity before requiring the user to re-authenticate.

In some cases, some operations in CrafterCMS may last longer than the user session inactivity timeout settings.
For this scenario, the session inactivity timeout will need to be modified to allow the operation to finish
without the session timing out. Also, you may want to change the timeouts from the default settings.

Here's a summary of the session timeouts available in CrafterCMS:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 1 8
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Timeout Name
     - Default Value |br|
       *(in minutes)*
     - Description
   * - ``sessionTimeout``
     - 480
     - **Studio session lifetime timeout** |br|
       *Location:* |br|
       *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml* |br| |br|
       The amount of time a session is valid counting from when a user is logged in. |br|
       After this amount of time,a session timeout will be forced in the application layer even if the user is active.
   * - ``inactivityTimeout``
     - 30
     - **Studio session inactivity timeout** |br|
       *Location:* |br|
       *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml* |br| |br|
       The amount of time of user inactivity, tracked by Studio, before requiring the user to re-authenticate. |br|
       Remember to set the ``inactivityTimeout`` value less than the ``session-timeout`` value in the ``web.xml`` file. |br|
       The session inactivity time tracked by Studio is different from the session inactivity time tracked by Tomcat. |br|
       This is because there are some API calls that are not tracked as active by Studio.
   * - ``session-timeout``
     - 30
     - **Tomcat session timeout** |br|
       *Location:* |br|
       *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/webapps/studio/WEB-INF/web.xml* |br| |br|
       The amount of time of user inactivity, tracked by Tomcat, before requiring the user to re-authenticate. |br|
       This value must be greater than or equal to ``inactivityTimeout`` since that timeout can and does kick in |br|
       before this one.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Change Session Lifetime Timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To change the session lifetime timeout, in your
``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml``,
change the value for ``studio.security.sessionTimeout`` to desired amount of time the session is valid
in minutes for users.

.. code-block:: properties

   # Time in minutes after which active users will be required to login again
   # studio.security.sessionTimeout: 480

|

Make sure to stop and **restart Studio** after making your changes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Change Session Inactivity Timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two timeouts you can configure for the session inactivity timeout as described in the above table.

- ``session-timeout`` in the Tomcat ``web.xml`` file
  This is the default Tomcat timeout for handling idle connections (inactive)
- ``inactivityTimeout`` in the Studio override configuration file
  This is the Studio session inactivity timeout

To change the session inactivity timeout, follow the instructions below:

#. In your ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml``,
   change the value for ``studio.security.inactivityTimeout`` to set the amount of time in minutes the amount of
   time a user can be inactive before the user's session times out.

   .. code-block:: properties

      # Time in minutes after which inactive users will be required to login again
      # studio.security.inactivityTimeout: 30

   |

#. In your ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/webapps/studio/WEB-INF/web.xml`` file, change the value in
   between the ``session-timeout`` tags to desired amount of time the session will exist in minutes:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <session-config>
        <session-timeout>30</session-timeout>
        <tracking-mode>COOKIE</tracking-mode>
	  </session-config>

   |


Remember to keep the Studio session inactivity timeout ``inactivityTimeout`` from the ``studio-config-override.yaml`` file less than the Tomcat ``session-timeout`` from the ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/webapps/studio/WEB-INF/web.xml`` file.

Make sure to stop and **restart Studio after making your changes**.

You can also change the Studio session timeouts from the |mainMenu| **Main Menu** in Studio under ``Global Config``

where:

- ``STUDIO_TOKEN_ISSUER``, ``STUDIO_TOKEN_VALID_ISSUERS``, ``STUDIO_TOKEN_AUDIENCE`` |br|
  These variables are used in the JWT claims set. See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1 for more
  information on JWT claims set.

- ``STUDIO_TOKEN_TIMEOUT`` |br|
  This variable sets the expiration of the JWT token in minutes (default is 5 minutes). The expiration value is also
  injected into the JWT claims when a token is published. This cannot be changed after the token is published.
  After the expiration time, the token is invalid and a new token must be published to use for API calls. (This can be
  done automatically with the ``refresh_token`` in the UI)

- ``STUDIO_TOKEN_SIGN_PASSWORD`` |br|
  This variable is used for the Signature part of the JWT token. The signature is used to verify the message wasn't
  changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of
  the JWT is who it says it is. For Studio, we use HMAC_SHA512 algorithm for the signature.

- ``STUDIO_TOKEN_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD`` |br|
  This variable is used for encrypting the JWT token itself so that it won't be decrypted without a password.

- ``STUDIO_REFRESH_TOKEN_NAME``, ``STUDIO_REFRESH_TOKEN_MAX_AGE``, ``STUDIO_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECURE`` |br|
  These variables are used for customizing the refresh token cookie. JWT token is short lived in general and we use a
  refresh token to exchange for a new JWT token when the old one is expired. By default the cookie name is ``refresh_token``.
  When creating a new access token, the backend will validate if the refresh token cookie is valid. You should find
  this from the cookies in the browser while logging in with Studio.

For more information on JWT tokens in general, see https://jwt.io/introduction.
For information on creating access tokens in Studio, see :ref:`here <api-token>`.

    studio.security.token.previewCookie.httpOnly: true
    Password requirements validation allows the admin to setup rules that ensures users create passwords based on an organization’s password security policy.

The Preview cookie  ``crafterPreview`` is encrypted using the encryption option for configuration files (which are
shared between Studio and Engine) and admins will need to update the default configurations for the encryption key and
salt in :ref:`Studio <studio-cipher-configuration>` and in :ref:`Engine <engine-configuration-properties-encryption>`.

Use the API :base_url:`switchPreviewSite <_static/api/studio.html#tag/users/operation/getCurrentUserSites>` to refresh
the ``crafterPreview`` cookie. This API must be called whenever the ``crafterSite`` cookie value is updated

`here <https://github.com/craftercms/studio/blob/support/4.x/src/main/resources/crafter/studio/groovy/blacklist>`__.
Make sure you review the branch/tag you're using.

To use a custom blacklist follow these steps:

#. Copy the default blacklist file to your classpath, for example:

    ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/groovy/blacklist``

#. Remove or comment (adding a ``#`` at the beginning of the line) the expressions that your scripts require
#. Update the ``studio-config-override.yaml`` configuration file to load the custom blacklist:

    .. code-block:: yaml
        :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml*

        # The location of the default blacklist to use (this will have no effect if the sandbox is disabled)
        studio.scripting.sandbox.blacklist.path: classpath:crafter/studio/groovy/blacklist

#. Restart CrafterCMS

Now you can execute the same script without any issues.

|

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Disabling the Sandbox Blacklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to disable the blacklist to allow the execution of most expressions, in case you need to use a
considerable number of the expression included in the blacklist while keeping some basic restrictions. To disable
the blacklist for all projects/sites update the ``studio-config-override.yaml`` configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml*

    # Indicates if the blacklist should be enabled (this will have no effect if the sandbox is disabled)
    studio.scripting.sandbox.blacklist.enable: false

|

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using a Custom Whitelist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. version_tag::
    :label: Since
    :version: 4.5.0

Crafter Studio includes a default whitelist that you can find
`here <https://github.com/craftercms/studio/blob/support/4.x/src/main/resources/crafter/studio/groovy/whitelist>`__.
Make sure you review the branch/tag you're using.

To use a custom whitelist follow these steps:

#. Copy the default whitelist file to your classpath, for example:

    ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/groovy/whitelist``

#. Add, remove or comment (adding a ``#`` at the beginning of the line) the expressions that your scripts require
#. Update the ``studio-config-override.yaml`` configuration file to load the custom whitelist:

    .. code-block:: yaml
        :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml*

        # The location of the default whitelist to use (this will have no effect if the sandbox is disabled)
        studio.scripting.sandbox.whitelist.path: classpath:crafter/studio/groovy/whitelist

#. Restart CrafterCMS

Now you can execute the same script without any issues.

Much of the administration of Crafter Studio can be done via the UI. This section describes how to perform these basic tasks.

.. _navigating-main-menu:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Navigating the Navigation Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this section, we discuss the Navigation Menu tools available in Studio. To access, click the ``Navigation Menu`` icon from the top right of the browser

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/main-menu/open-main-menu.webp
    :alt: System Administrator - Open Navigation Menu
    :align: center
    :width: 100%

|

Here are the list of tools available when using an out of the box blueprint. The ``Navigation Menu`` tools described below are available to users belonging to the ``system_admin`` group.

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/main-menu/main-menu.webp
    :alt: System Administrator - Navigation Menu
    :align: center
    :width: 20%

|

The configuration files for the Navigation Menu is located in ``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/global/configuration/`` where:

* :ref:`global-menu-config.xml <global-menu-config>` lets you setup the list of tools available from the Navigation Menu sidebar
* :ref:`global-permission-mappings-config.xml <global-permission-mappings-config>` lets you configure the permissions to a role globally for the entire application
* :ref:`global-role-mappings-config.xml <global-role-mappings-config>` lets you configure the mapping between the group and the role

The tools available in the Navigation Menu is configured similar to how the Project Tools Sidebar is configured :ref:`here <project-tools-ui-configuration>` using the :ref:`global menu config <global-menu-config>` configuration file mentioned above.

.. _main-menu-tool-projects:

""""""""
Projects
""""""""
``Projects`` contains a list of all the projects the logged in user has access to. The section :ref:`author-screens` in ``Content Authors`` contains descriptions on some of the actions that can be performed from the Projects screen.  This also allows users with the system admin role to create new projects either from a :ref:`blueprint <your-first-editorial-project>`, a :ref:`remote repository <create-project-with-link-to-remote-repo>` or an :ref:`existing project <duplicate-project>`.

:ref:`override-logging-levels` contains more information on how to track Java packages with the corresponding log levels desired.

The ``Log Console`` here in the Main Menu is similar to a project ``Log Console`` described :ref:`here <studio-log-console>`. The difference is the ``Log Console`` from the Main Menu can display logs for all the projects inside Studio, not just one project.

.. _nav-menu-global-config:

"""""""""""""
Global Config
"""""""""""""
CrafterCMS allows the user to edit the system settings for Studio without access to the physical server through ``Global Config`` under the ``Navigation Menu`` in Studio.
This global configuration file overrides the core configuration of Crafter Studio, ``studio-config.yaml``,  found in your Authoring installation, under ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/webapps/studio/WEB-INF/classes/crafter/studio``, and the Studio configuration override file ``studio-config-override.yaml`` under ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension`` in your Authoring installation (for more information on this file, see :ref:`studio-config`.

Changes made to this file will spread to all nodes in a Studio cluster automatically. Please note that not all changes to this file can/will take effect without a restart, so expect to have to **restart Studio for most changes to take effect**. If in a cluster, you'll need a rolling restart for all nodes to pick up the changes.

To access the Global Config, click on the ``Navigation Menu`` icon at the top right corner, then click on ``Global Config`` in the Global panel

API Token
~~~~~~~~~
JWT authentication using API access tokens allows the user to access Studio APIs as a particular user with a particular role.

To create a new API access token, click on ``Token Management`` from the Main Menu, then click on the ``API Token`` button.
The only required field for the access token is the label to identify it, however, it is also recommended to set
an expiration date to minimize the risk of lost or stolen tokens being used without being noticed.

The access token created from the tool is used for JWT authentication to be able to interact with Crafter Studio APIs.
For an example of how to use the generated access token, see :ref:`crafter-cli`.

If an access token is lost or exposed in any way it should be disabled or completely deleted to avoid any
possible use. To delete a token, simply click on the trash can icon to the right of the token you want to delete.

    :alt: Crafter Studio - Delete a Token
    :align: center

You can also delete multiple tokens at once by placing a checkmark on the tokens you want to delete, then clicking on
``Delete Selected``.

To disable/enable a token, simply click on the slider on the right side of the token next to the trash can icon.

	:version: 4.2.0

Preview tokens allow preview applications to access delivery APIs in preview mode from within the authoring environment.
This extra layer of security is required in authoring because the environment contains unpublished projects and content.

To create a Preview Token, click on ``Token Management`` from the Main Menu, then click on the ``Preview Token`` button.

.. figure:: /_static/images/system-admin/main-menu/create-preview-token.webp
    :width: 70%
    :alt: Crafter Studio - Create Preview Access Token
    :align: center

|

The only required fields for the preview token is the dropdown for selecting projects to grant preview access, and the
date/time fields to set an expiration date for the token, which is pre-populated to a date in the near future. The expiration
date is set to minimize the risk of lost or stolen tokens being used without being noticed. Click on the ``Generate``
button to create the token.

.. figure:: /_static/images/system-admin/main-menu/create-preview-token-2.webp
    :width: 70%
    :alt: Crafter Studio - Create Preview Access Token
    :align: center

|

The next step is to copy the value of the preview token. The value of the preview token is not stored on the server,
so it needs to be stored by the user in a safe place as it is impossible to recover it after it is created.

.. figure:: /_static/images/system-admin/main-menu/preview-token-created.webp
    :width: 70%
    :alt: Crafter Studio - Create Preview Access Token
    :align: center

|

You can now use the preview token in one of the following ways:

- Set a header with the name X-Crafter-Preview, or
- Add a query string argument with the name crafterPreview, or
- Set a cookie with the name crafterPreview

Here's an example of using the token with Curl, where ``{Generated-Preview-Token}`` is the token just created:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl --header "cookie: crafterPreview={Generated-Preview-Token};" "http://localhost:8080/api/1/site/content_store/item.json?url=/site/website/index.xml&crafterSite=ed"


The dialog above that shows the preview token generated also shows other examples on how to use the preview token.

.. _user-group-management:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
User/Group Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This section describes managing user accounts and groups.

A user is anybody who uses CrafterCMS. A user account holds a user name and password. A group consists of a collection of users. Users can be assigned to a group for a project/site. Through the groups, roles are assigned to users to certain areas of the site (access rights/ permissions). Each role represents a set of activities allowed. Groups are  used to simplify management as changes made to the rights of the group applies to all the users belonging to that group.

When you work in Crafter Studio, you need to login as a user. Your CrafterCMS administrator sets up user accounts, group memberships, roles and permissions. The sections below goes into more detail on how users, groups, permissions and roles are administered/setup.


.. _roles-and-permissions:

"""""""""""""""""""""
Roles and Permissions
"""""""""""""""""""""
To access CrafterCMS, a user must be allowed access rights to certain areas of the project (access rights/ permissions). For example, if a user wants to create, edit or submit content, the user needs to have those specific permissions. Here, we see that the user requires multiple permissions. For simplicity, permissions are grouped together into **roles**. A role is a set of allowed actions/activities. An **author** role, for example, has access to create, edit and submit content.

To define permissions for users, they need to be a member of a group. A group is a collection of users with a role assigned. Groups are used to simplify management as changes made to the rights of the group applies to all the users belonging to that group. For our example above of a user that wants to create, edit or submit content, the user should be assigned to a group with the **author** role.

Out of the box, CrafterCMS supports the following roles/groups:

============== ================= =========================================================
Role           Group             Description
============== ================= =========================================================
system_admin   system_admin      Has access to everything in the CMS, such as all the projects, users, groups, etc. in addition to the admin role
admin          site_admin        Has access to everything in the project such as project configurations, creating/editing layouts, templates, taxonomies, content types, scripts, etc. in addition to the publisher role
author         site_author       Has access to create, edit or submit content in a project
developer      site_developer    Has access to access to creating/editing layouts, templates, taxonomies, content types, scripts, etc., project configurations in addition to the publisher role in a project
reviewer       site_reviewer     Has the ability to approve and reject workflow, but don't have access to the author role in a project
publisher      site_publisher    Has the ability to approve and reject workflow, in addition to the author role in a project
============== ================= =========================================================

Permissions and roles can be setup for each project, and for the entire application itself. Note that the ``system_admin`` role applies to the entire application and the rest of the default roles applies to a project.

See :ref:`groups-management` for more information on administrating groups.

~~~~~~~~
Projects
~~~~~~~~
To edit permissions for a project role, in Studio, from the *Sidebar*, click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *Permission Mapping*. See :ref:`permission-mappings` for more information on permissions and the default permissions assigned to roles.

To add/edit a role for a project, in Studio, from the *Sidebar*, click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *Role Mapping*. See :ref:`project-role-mappings` for more information.

The items for interaction/tools available from the **Sidebar** depending on the user role can be configured in Studio, from the *Sidebar*, click on |projectTools| -> *Configuration* -> *User Interface Configuration*. See :ref:`user-interface-configuration` for more information.

Global
~~~~~~
To add/edit a global role/group, see :ref:`global-role-mappings-config` for more information.

To add/edit global permissions for a role, see :ref:`global-permission-mappings-config` for more information.

The items for interaction/tools available from the |mainMenu| *Main Menu* depending on the user role can be configured by opening the :ref:`global-menu-config.xml <global-menu-config>` file under ``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/global/configuration`` using your favorite editor.

.. _putting-it-all-together:

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Putting it all together - Users, Groups, Roles and Permissions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
In this section, we'll see how users, groups, roles and permissions work together in giving users access to
certain folders in a project.

We'll create a new role, group and user, add permissions for the new role and finally assign the newly
created user to the new group setup.

In preparation for our example, we will be using the Website editorial blueprint. We'll add a **news** folder
under **Home**, by navigating to **Pages** -> **Home**, then right click on **Home** and select **New Folder**.
Enter *news* in the **Folder Name** field. We will be using the **news** folder for our example in setting up
permissions to folders based on roles. Users assigned to the **newseditor** role will then have access to
publish and add/edit content in the **news** folder.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _create-project-with-link-to-remote-repo:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Project Creation with Remote Repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Crafter Studio supports project creation with remote repositories and provides two options:

- Create project based on remote Git repository
- Create project based on a blueprint then add a remote Git repository

To start creating a project with a remote repository, from the **Projects** screen, click on the **Create Project** button.
A **Create Project** dialog will be launched. For both options, there will be a screen where the **Remote Git Repository Name** and **Remote Git Repository URL** needs to be filled out and the rest is optional and only needs to be filled out if required by the remote git repository being used.

Let's take a look at the fields where the remote repository details needs to be filled in:

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/remote-repo-info.webp
   :alt: System Administrator - Remote Repository Details
   :width: 55 %
   :align: center

|

#. In the **Git Repo URL** field you must provide the link to the Git repository you would like to use
#. In the **Authentication** field you must select the authentication method to be used to access the Git repository in the previous field.

   CrafterCMS supports the following authentication types to use to access remote repository:

   - **Authentication not required (Public URL)** - no credentials needed to access remote repository
   - **Username & Password** - for this method, you will be asked for a **Remote Git Repository Username** and a **Remote Git Repository Password**. Supply your username and password
   - **Token** - for this method, you will be asked for a **Remote Git Repository Username** (if required) and a **Remote Git Repository Token**. This method is usually used when two-factor authentication is configured on the remote repository to be accessed. Supply your username if required and token.
   - **Private Key** - for this method, you will be asked for a **Remote Git Repository Private Key**. This method is a key-based authentication. Supply your private key.

#. In the **Git Branch** field, you can supply a branch name, but can be left blank, which in turn would default to the ``master`` branch.
#. In the **Git Remote Name** field you want to provide a repository name that makes sense. It’s common to use “origin” or “upstream.”

Click on the **Site ID** field where you'll need to give your project an ID. Scroll down to see where you can fill in all the information for the remote repository we are importing. The ``Git Repo URL`` is the import project's sandbox repository git url (the project you want to bring over to your Studio). Below are sample urls for the project being imported:

Here is a sample Git url from GitHub:
`https://github.com/username/hello-test.git`
