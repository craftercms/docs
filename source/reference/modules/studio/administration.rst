|

Here are the list of tools available when using an out of the box blueprint. The ``Navigation Menu`` tools described below are available to users belonging to the ``system_admin`` group.

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/main-menu/main-menu.webp
    :alt: System Administrator - Navigation Menu
    :align: center
    :width: 20%

The configuration files for the Navigation Menu is located in ``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/global/configuration/`` where:

* :ref:`global-menu-config.xml <global-menu-config>` lets you setup the list of tools available from the Navigation Menu sidebar
* :ref:`global-permission-mappings-config.xml <global-permission-mappings-config>` lets you configure the permissions to a role globally for the entire application
* :ref:`global-role-mappings-config.xml <global-role-mappings-config>` lets you configure the mapping between the group and the role

The tools available in the Navigation Menu is configured similar to how the Project Tools Sidebar is configured :ref:`here <project-tools-ui-configuration>` using the :ref:`global menu config <global-menu-config>` configuration file mentioned above.

.. _main-menu-tool-projects:

.. _nav-menu-global-config:

-----------------------------
Navigation Menu Global Config
-----------------------------
CrafterCMS allows the user to edit the system settings for Studio without access to the physical server through ``Global Config`` under the ``Navigation Menu`` in Studio.
This global configuration file overrides the core configuration of Crafter Studio, ``studio-config.yaml``,  found in your Authoring installation, under ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/webapps/studio/WEB-INF/classes/crafter/studio``, and the Studio configuration override file ``studio-config-override.yaml`` under ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension`` in your Authoring installation (for more information on this file, see :ref:`studio-config`.

Changes made to this file will spread to all nodes in a Studio cluster automatically. Please note that not all changes to this file can/will take effect without a restart, so expect to have to **restart Studio for most changes to take effect**. If in a cluster, you'll need a rolling restart for all nodes to pick up the changes.

To access the Global Config, click on the ``Navigation Menu`` icon at the top right corner, then click on ``Global Config`` in the Global panel

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/main-menu/main-menu-global-config.webp

.. _user-group-management:

---------------------
User/Group Management
---------------------
This section describes managing user accounts and groups.

A user is anybody who uses CrafterCMS. A user account holds a user name and password. A group consists of a collection of users. Users can be assigned to a group for a project/site. Through the groups, roles are assigned to users to certain areas of the site (access rights/ permissions). Each role represents a set of activities allowed. Groups are  used to simplify management as changes made to the rights of the group applies to all the users belonging to that group.

When you work in Crafter Studio, you need to login as a user. Your CrafterCMS administrator sets up user accounts, group memberships, roles and permissions. The sections below goes into more detail on how users, groups, permissions and roles are administered/setup.

.. _users-management:

.. _roles-and-permissions:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Roles and Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To access CrafterCMS, a user must be allowed access rights to certain areas of the project (access rights/ permissions). For example, if a user wants to create, edit or submit content, the user needs to have those specific permissions. Here, we see that the user requires multiple permissions. For simplicity, permissions are grouped together into **roles**. A role is a set of allowed actions/activities. An **author** role, for example, has access to create, edit and submit content.

To define permissions for users, they need to be a member of a group. A group is a collection of users with a role assigned. Groups are used to simplify management as changes made to the rights of the group applies to all the users belonging to that group. For our example above of a user that wants to create, edit or submit content, the user should be assigned to a group with the **author** role.

Out of the box, CrafterCMS supports the following roles/groups:

============== ================= =========================================================
Role           Group             Description
============== ================= =========================================================
system_admin   system_admin      Has access to everything in the CMS, such as all the projects, users, groups, etc. in addition to the admin role
admin          site_admin        Has access to everything in the project such as project configurations, creating/editing layouts, templates, taxonomies, content types, scripts, etc. in addition to the publisher role
author         site_author       Has access to create, edit or submit content in a project
developer      site_developer    Has access to access to creating/editing layouts, templates, taxonomies, content types, scripts, etc., project configurations in addition to the publisher role in a project
reviewer       site_reviewer     Has the ability to approve and reject workflow, but don't have access to the author role in a project
publisher      site_publisher    Has the ability to approve and reject workflow, in addition to the author role in a project
============== ================= =========================================================

Permissions and roles can be setup for each project, and for the entire application itself. Note that the ``system_admin`` role applies to the entire application and the rest of the default roles applies to a project.

See :ref:`groups-management` for more information on administrating groups.

Putting it all together - Users, Groups, Roles and Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this section, we'll see how users, groups, roles and permissions work together in giving users access to
certain folders in a project.

We'll create a new role, group and user, add permissions for the new role and finally assign the newly
created user to the new group setup.

In preparation for our example, we will be using the Website editorial blueprint. We'll add a **news** folder
under **Home**, by navigating to **Pages** -> **Home**, then right click on **Home** and select **New Folder**.
Enter *news* in the **Folder Name** field. We will be using the **news** folder for our example in setting up
permissions to folders based on roles. Users assigned to the **newseditor** role will then have access to
publish and add/edit content in the **news** folder.

""""""""""""""""""
Create a new group
""""""""""""""""""
Let's begin by creating a new group.

#. To create a new group, click on |mainMenu| **Navigation Menu** from the top right, then click on **Groups**.
#. Click on the **Create Group** button.
#. Enter a name for the new group being created in the **Display Name** field.
#. Enter a description of the new group being created in the **Description** field.
#. Click on the **Save** button. A notification will appear that your new group has been created.

Below are the information used to create a new group:

-----------------------------------------
Project Creation with Remote Repositories
-----------------------------------------
Crafter Studio supports project creation with remote repositories and provides two options:

- Create project based on remote Git repository
- Create project based on a blueprint then add a remote Git repository

To start creating a project with a remote repository, from the **Projects** screen, click on the **Create Project** button.
A **Create Project** dialog will be launched. For both options, there will be a screen where the **Remote Git Repository Name** and **Remote Git Repository URL** needs to be filled out and the rest is optional and only needs to be filled out if required by the remote git repository being used.

Let's take a look at the fields where the remote repository details needs to be filled in:

.. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/remote-repo-info.webp
   :alt: System Administrator - Remote Repository Details
   :width: 55 %
   :align: center

|

#. In the **Git Repo URL** field you must provide the link to the Git repository you would like to use
#. In the **Authentication** field you must select the authentication method to be used to access the Git repository in the previous field.

   CrafterCMS supports the following authentication types to use to access remote repository:

    - **Authentication not required (Public URL)** - no credentials needed to access remote repository
    - **Username & Password** - for this method, you will be asked for a **Remote Git Repository Username** and a **Remote Git Repository Password**. Supply your username and password
    - **Token** - for this method, you will be asked for a **Remote Git Repository Username** (if required) and a **Remote Git Repository Token**. This method is usually used when two-factor authentication is configured on the remote repository to be accessed. Supply your username if required and token.
    - **Private Key** - for this method, you will be asked for a **Remote Git Repository Private Key**. This method is a key-based authentication. Supply your private key.

#. In the **Git Branch** field, you can supply a branch name, but can be left blank, which in turn would default to the ``master`` branch.
#. In the **Git Remote Name** field you want to provide a repository name that makes sense. It’s common to use “origin” or “upstream.”

Create project based on a blueprint then add a remote bare Git repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To create a project based on a blueprint then add a remote bare git repository, click on **Create Site** from **Sites**, then select the blueprint you would like to use

    :alt: Create Site Dialog in Crafter Studio, select a blueprint
    :width: 70 %
    :align: center

|

The next step is to fill in the **Project ID** and **Project Name**, then click on the **Review** button, then finally  click on the **Create Project** button to create your project. Your project should be created in a short while.

.. image:: /_static/images/developer/dev-cloud-platforms/create-project-then-push-2.webp
    :alt: Create Site Dialog in Crafter Studio, fill in Site ID
    :width: 70 %
    :align: center

|

Once your project is created, the next step is to add a remote repository to your newly created project. Open the **Sidebar** then click on **Site Config** -> **Remote Repositories**, then click on the **New Repository** on the top right.
This will open up a dialog where we can fill in all the information for our remote repository as described above. Click on the **Create** button after filling in the required information.

Your project should now have a remote repository listed in the **Remotes** screen

Remember that the remote repository needs to be a bare git repository, since we are pushing our newly created project to the remote repository. To push our newly create project to the remote repository, click on the ``Push`` button (button with the up arrow) next to the remote repository

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Create project based on a remote Git repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Creating a project based on a remote Git repository is basically exporting a project from one Studio and importing it into another one.

To create a project based on remote Git repository, after clicking on **Create Project**, Click on **Remote Git Repository** in the **Private Blueprints** tab create project screen

Click on the **Site ID** field where you'll need to give your project an ID. Scroll down to see where you can fill in all the information for the remote repository we are importing. The ``Git Repo URL`` is the import project's sandbox repository git url (the project you want to bring over to your Studio). Below are sample urls for the project being imported:

Here is a sample Git url from GitHub:
`https://github.com/username/hello-test.git`
Here is a sample Git url using ssh:
`ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo/`
or alternatively for ssh:
`[user@]host.xz:path/to/repo/`
