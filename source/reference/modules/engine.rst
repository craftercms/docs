Engine provides content delivery services to power any type of Web or mobile application. It consumes content published from Studio via the Deployer and provides developers with APIs to consume the content (content, search, GraphQL, etc.).

   ``HOST:PORT/?crafterSite=site1`` will render the home page for ``site1``

   ``HOST:PORT/?crafterSite=site2`` will render the home page for ``site2``

   |

   Aside from the ``crafterSite`` parameter, a header can be sent to specify the site name, called
   ``X-Crafter-Site`` for changing the current site. This is very useful when Crafter Engine is used
   together with CDNs that can send headers, like AWS CloudFront

   .. WARNING::
       Using this configuration you need to be sure that the first request specifies the site name by
       including the ``crafterSite`` parameter (or the ``X-Crafter-Site`` header) so that the site value
       is set in the cookie for the next requests.

   |

   .. note::
         Crafter Engine identifies which project to render by the mechanisms (in this order of precedence):
            - Headers (``X-Crafter-Site={site}``)
            - QSA (Query String Parameters: ``crafterSite={site}``)
            - Cookie (``crafterSite={site}``)

         Additionally, if the cookie is not aligned with other parameters, the cookie will be reset to what precedes it.
         The above is only true when Crafter Engine is not in Preview mode.

In this section, we will be working in the delivery environment of CrafterCMS and describing how to setup your project for a delivery environment.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Setup Crafter Deployer Target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CrafterCMS out of the box has a script to help you create your deployer target for the delivery environment.

In the ``bin`` folder in your CrafterCMS delivery environment, we will use the script ``init-site.sh`` to help us create the deployer target.

From your command line, navigate to your ``{Crafter-CMS-delivery-environment-directory}/bin/`` , and execute the init-site script. The following output of ``init-site.sh -h``
explains how to use the script:

  .. code-block:: bash
    :force:

    usage: init-site [options] [site] [repo-path]
     -a,--notification-addresses <addresses>   A comma-separated list of email
                                               addresses that should receive
                                               deployment notifications
     -b,--branch <branch>                      The name of the branch to clone
                                               (live by default)
     -f,--passphrase <passphrase>              The passphrase of the private
                                               key (when the key is passphrase
                                               protected)
     -h,--help                                 Show usage information
     -k,--private-key <path>                   The path to the private key, when
                                               using private-key authentication
                                               through SSH to the remote Git repo
     -p,--password <password>                  The password for the remote Git
                                               repo, when using basic
                                               authentication
     -u,--username <username>                  The username for the remote Git
                                               repo, when using basic
                                               authentication
     --addresses <>                            A comma-separated list of email
                                               addresses that should receive deployment notifications

    EXAMPLES:
     Init a site from the default repo path (../../crafter-authoring/data/repos/sites/{sitename}/published)
         init-site mysite
     Init a site from a specific local repo path
         init-site mysite /opt/crafter/authoring/data/repos/sites/mysite/published
     Init a site from a specific local repo path, cloning a specific branch of the repo
         init-site -b master mysite /opt/crafter/authoring/data/repos/sites/mysite/published
     Init a site that is in a remote HTTPS repo with username/password authentication
         init-site -u jdoe -p jdoe1234 mysite https://github.com/jdoe/mysite.git
     Init a site that is in a remote SSH repo with public/private key authentication (specific private key path
     with no passphrase)
         init-site -k ~/.ssh/jdoe_key mysite ssh://myserver/opt/crater/sites/mysite
     Init a site that is in a remote SSH repo with public/private key authentication (specific private key path
     with passphrase)
         init-site -k ~/.ssh/jdoe_key -f jdoe123 mysite ssh://myserver/opt/crater/sites/mysite

.. include:: /includes/ssh-private-key.rst

We recommend using Secure Shell (SSH) with your project's published repo Git URL and for authentication, to use either username/password authentication or public/private key
authentication.

The SSH Git URL format is: ``ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo/`` where sections between **[]** are optional.

Example #1: ``ssh://server1.example.com/path/to/repo``

Example #2: ``ssh://jdoe@server2.example.com:63022/path/to/repo``

.. note::
  .. include:: /includes/setup-ssh-keys.rst

If you are just working on another directory on disk for your delivery, you can just use the filesystem. When your repository is local, make sure to use the absolute path.
Here is an example project's published repo Git url when using a local repository:

  .. code-block:: bash

      /opt/crafter/authoring/data/repos/sites/my-project/published

.. note::
  * When using ``ssh``, you might see in the logs ``com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: UnknownHostKey`` errors. These errors are common in Ubuntu, and are caused by known host keys being stored in non-RSA format. Please follow the instructions in :ref:`debugging-deployer-issues` under ``SSH Unknown Host`` to resolve them.

  * ``Git`` needs to be installed in authoring when using SSH to connect the delivery to the authoring.

    If you see the following error in the delivery Deployer: `Caused by: java.io.IOException: bash: git-upload-pack: command not found` you'll need to add the location of git (usually **/usr/bin**) to your non-login shell startup file (e.g. **~/.bashrc**).

    To get the location of Git, run the following command: ``which git-upload-pack``
  * You can limit SSH access by using Git Shell, see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-shell for more information.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Viewing your Site for Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To test viewing your project, open a browser and type in the URL of your project.

If you have multiple projects setup, to view a certain project, in your browser, enter the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    {Server URL}?crafterSite={siteName}

Here we have an example of a delivery setup in another directory on disk (local), where there are two projects, ``my-awesome-editorial`` and ``hello-world``

Serverless Delivery
"""""""""""""""""""
CrafterCMS can be configured to serve sites directly from AWS services, following this guide you will:

- Create a AWS OpenSearch domain (optional)
- Configure a Crafter Studio in an authoring environment to call the Crafter Deployer to create an AWS CloudFormation
  with a CloudFront and S3 bucket for each site
- Configure a Crafter Engine in a delivery environment to read files from the S3 bucket and query to AWS OpenSearch (optional)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- An AWS account
- A CrafterCMS authoring environment
- A CrafterCMS delivery environment

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 1: Create an OpenSearch Domain for Delivery (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since serverless delivery requires a single OpenSearch endpoint readable by all Engine instances, we recommend you
create an AWS OpenSearch domain for delivery. If you don't want to use an AWS OpenSearch domain then you should
create and maintain your own OpenSearch cluster.

To create an AWS OpenSearch domain please do the following:

.. important::
    The following are settings used in common Crafter deployments with AWS OpenSearch, and by no means should be
    considered the only way to configure AWS OpenSearch with Crafter.

#. In the top navigation bar of your AWS console, on the search bar, enter ``Amazon OpenSearch Service``.
#. Click on ``Create domain``.
#. Select ``Standard Create`` on ``Domain creation method``.
#. On ``Templates``, select ``Dev/test``.

.. important::
    Even for Production deployments, we recommend you pick the ``Dev/test`` template. We do this because that's the only
    way to avoid setting dedicated master nodes. AWS recommends in all Production environments to use dedicated master
    nodes. From experience, most Crafter Production deployments don't need dedicated master nodes, but that will depend
    on your project's search utilization.

#. On ``Deployment Options``, select ``Domain without standby`` and ``3-AZ``.
#. On the ``Engine options`` section, select ``Include older versions`` and pick ``2.9`` as the version.
#. On ``Data Nodes``, pick a configuration for the nodes like the one showed in the image below. For volume size, most Crafter installations
   should be ok with 20 GB per node, but you can adjust the size based on ``number of projects * average project size in GB * 3 (for preview,
   authoring and delivery indices)``.

   .. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/serverless/os-data-nodes-config.webp
       :alt: Serverless Site - OpenSearch Data Nodes Configuration
       :align: center

   |

#. On ``Network``, we recommend you pick the VPC and subnets where your delivery nodes reside. Make sure that the security group
   only allows access to port 443 from the delivery nodes. If they're not running on an Amazon VPC, then pick ``Public Access``
#. On the ``Fine-grained access control``, select ``Create master user``, and specify a username and password (save this for later).
#. Select ``Only use fine-grained access control`` in ``Access Policy``.
#. Adjust any other setting to your preferences, and click on ``Create`` on the right sidebar.

   .. image:: /_static/images/system-admin/serverless/os-domain-summary.webp
       :alt: Serverless Site - OpenSearch Domain Summary
       :align: center

   |

#. Wait until the domain has been created, then copy the ``Domain Endpoint``.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 2: Configure the Delivery for Serverless Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Edit the services override file to enable the Serverless S3 mode
   (``DELIVERY_INSTALL_DIR/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/services-context.xml``):

   .. code-block:: xml

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

        <import resource="classpath*:crafter/engine/mode/multi-tenant/simple/services-context.xml" />
        <!-- S3 Serverless Mode -->
        <import resource="classpath*:crafter/engine/mode/serverless/s3/services-context.xml" />

      </beans>

   |

#. Edit the properties override file to point Engine to consume the site content from S3
   (``DELIVERY_INSTALL_DIR/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties``). The
   properties you need to update are the following:

   - ``crafter.engine.site.default.rootFolder.path``
   - ``crafter.engine.s3.region``
   - ``crafter.engine.s3.accessKey``
   - ``crafter.engine.s3.secretKey``

   An example of how the :ref:`server-config.properties <engine-configuration-files>` would look with configuration to read from an S3 bucket per site
   (which is the most common use case), is the following (values in ``X`` are not displayed since they're sensitive):

   .. code-block:: properties
      :caption: *DELIVERY_INSTALL_DIR/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*
      :force:

      # Content root folder when using S3 store. Format is s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/<SITES_ROOT>/{siteName}
      crafter.engine.site.default.rootFolder.path=s3://serverless-delivery-test-site-{siteName}
      ...

      # S3 Serverless properties
      # S3 region
      crafter.engine.s3.region=us-east-1
      # AWS access key
      crafter.engine.s3.accessKey=XXXXXXXXXX
      # AWS secret key
      crafter.engine.s3.secretKey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

   |

   As you can see, the bucket name portion of the root folder S3 URL contains a prefix and then the site name. This
   prefix is mentioned also as a "namespace" later on in the Studio serverless configuration.

   .. important:: You can also provide the AWS region, access key and secret key without having to edit the config file
                  properties. Please see
                  `Set up AWS Credentials and Region for Development <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html>`_.

#. We recommend that the AWS credentials configured belong to a user with just the following permission policy (all
   strings like ``$VAR`` are placeholders and need to be replaced):

   .. code-block:: json
      :caption: aws-serverless-engine-policy.json
      :linenos:

      {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                  "Resource": "*"
              },
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "s3:ListBucket",
                      "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                      "s3:GetObject"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET_NAME_PREFIX-*"
              }
          ]
      }

   |

#. Edit the ``SEARCH_URL`` in ``DELIVERY_INSTALL_DIR/bin/crafter-setenv.sh`` to point to the OpenSearch endpoint you
   created in the previous step, and provide the OpenSearch master credentials:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export SEARCH_URL="https://search-serverless-delivery-test-wyz36fsmutzsw2evgroc47lvve.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com"
      export SEARCH_USERNAME="*****"
      export SEARCH_PASSWORD="**********"

   |

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 3: Configure Authoring for Serverless Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Instead of having one Crafter Deployer per node in delivery, for serverless you just need a single Deployer uploading
files to S3. The authoring preview Deployer thus can also be used for serverless deployment.

.. note::
    In a Studio cluster, only one preview Deployer is active at a time and indexing (the one belonging to the primary).
    When using the preview Deployers for serverless, that also means only one Deployer will be pushing files to S3 at a
    time, so you don't need to worry about multiple deployers stepping over each other

You will need to configure Studio to call the preview Deployer to create the serverless targets on site creation.
You can find this configuration under ``AUTHORING_INSTALL_DIR/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/studio/extension/studio-config-override.yaml``.
The properties are well documented in the file so they won't be explained here, but there are still some important things to
notice:

- You can provide the URL of the OpenSearch domain created in a previous step under
  ``studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params.search_url``, but there's no current property to pass the credentials, which is why we
  recommend you to use ``SEARCH_URL``, ``SEARCH_USERNAME`` and  ``SEARCH_PASSWORD`` environment variables in ``AUTHORING_INSTALL_DIR/bin/crafter-setenv.sh``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export SEARCH_URL="https://search-serverless-delivery-test-wyz36fsmutzsw2evgroc47lvve.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com"
      export SEARCH_USERNAME="*****"
      export SEARCH_PASSWORD="**********"

   |

- When using the ``aws-cloudformed-s3`` target template (the default one), the Deployer creates first an AWS
  CloudFormation stack with an S3 bucket where the site content will be uploaded and a CloudFront that will serve
  ``/static-assets`` directly and will redirect any other requests to the Delivery Engine Load Balancer (which you specify in
  ``studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params.aws.cloudformation.deliveryLBDomainName``).
- The ``aws.cloudformation.namespace`` is basically the prefix of the S3 bucket mentioned in the previous step. This
  prefix will be part of the name of most of the AWS resources created by the serverless deployer.
- You need to specify proper AWS credentials for creating the CloudFormation stack and uploading files to S3, which can
  be done in the following ways:

  - As environment variables or under the default AWS credentials path, like explained in
    `Set up AWS Credentials and Region for Development <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html>`_.
  - In the ``aws.default_access_key`` and ``aws.default_secret_key`` properties under
    ``studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params``:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params:
         aws:
           # AWS access key (optional if specified through default AWS chain)
           default_access_key: XXXXXXXXXX
           # AWS secret key (optional if specified through default AWS chain)
           default_secret_key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

    |

  - In ``aws.cloudformation.access_key`` and ``aws.cloudformation.secret_key`` properties under
    ``studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params``, when specific CloudFormation credentials are needed:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params:
         aws:
           ...
           cloudformation:
             # AWS access key (optional if aws.accessKey is specified)
             access_key: XXXXXXXXXX
             # AWS secret key (optional if aws.secretKey is specified)
             secret_key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

    |

- We recommend that the AWS credentials configured belong to a user with just the following permission policy (all
  strings like ``$VAR`` are placeholders and need to be replaced):

  .. code-block:: json
     :caption: aws-serverless-deployer-policy.json
     :linenos:

- By default, the CloudFront created by Deployer will have a ``*.cloudfront.net`` domain name. To have CloudFront use
  additional domain name(s) please specify the AWS ARN of the domain SSL certificate (``cloudfrontCertificateArn``) and
  the alternate domain name(s) (``alternateCloudFrontDomainNames``):

  .. code-block:: yaml

     studio.serverless.delivery.deployer.target.template.params:
       aws:
         cloudformation:
           ...
           # The SSL certificate ARN the CloudFront CDN should use (optional when target template is aws-cloudformed-s3)
           cloudfrontCertificateArn: arn:aws:acm:...
           # The alternate domains names (besides *.cloudfront.net) for the CloudFront CDN (optional when target template is aws-cloudformed-s3)
           alternateCloudFrontDomainNames: myawesomesite.com,www.myawesomesite.com

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 4: Create the Site in the Authoring Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Login to the Crafter Studio in the authoring environment from your browser.
#. Click the ``Create Site`` button
#. Choose the ``Editorial`` blueprint, enter the ``Site Id`` (e.g. ``editorial``), and then review and create.
#. Go to your AWS console in your browser and on the ``Services`` dropdown search for CloudFormation. You should then
   see  the CloudFormation for the site you just created with the status ``CREATE_IN_PROGRESS``. After several minutes,
   the status should change to ``CREATE_COMPLETE``, which tells the Crafter Deployer that it is able to start
   uploading files to S3.

#. Wait at least 2 minutes for the Crafter Deployer to finish uploading the files and for the delivery Crafter Engine
   to warm up the new site in cache.

Crafter Engine can be configured at the project/site level or at the instance level.

.. _engine-site-configuration-files:

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Project-level/Site-level Configuration Files
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Crafter Engine provides a flexible configuration system that allows site administrators to change
the behavior of the project without the need to modify any code. Some properties are used by Crafter
Engine itself, but developers can also add any custom property they need for their code.

The main configuration files for a project/site can be edited within Crafter Studio's Project Tools > Configuration UI or via Git. These files are:

.. list-table:: Engine Project Configuration Files
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Configuration File
      - Description
    * - Engine Project Configuration (``config/engine/site-config.xml``)
      - Contains project properties used by Crafter Engine
    * - Engine Project Application Context (``config/engine/application-context.xml``)
      - Contains bean definitions for the site context associated with the Webapp
    * - URL Rewrite Configuration (XML Style) (``config/engine/urlrewrite.xml``)
      - Contains URL rewrite rules
    * - Proxy Config (``config/engine/proxy-config.xml``)
      - Configures the proxy servers for the Preview server (Crafter Engine in Preview Mode)

.. note:: All configuration files can be overridden by environment. Learn more about multi-environment support in :ref:`engine-multi-environment-support`.

The configuration file ``site-config.xml`` has some additional considerations. This file can be defined in:

- ``/config/engine/env/{envName}/site-config.xml``: This is the environment override, and is loaded first if present.
- ``/config/engine/site-config.xml``: This is the main configuration file for the project/site. This file is loaded if the environment override is not present.

.. note:: All properties will be available for developers in the Freemarker templates and Groovy scripts using the ``siteConfig`` variable. The ``siteConfig`` variable is an instance of the `XMLConfiguration <https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/XMLConfiguration.html>`_ class.

.. _engine-instance-configuration-files:

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Instance-level Configuration
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The main files for configuring Crafter Engine at the instance level are:

.. list-table:: Engine Instance Level Configuration Files
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Configuration File
      - Description
    * - ``server-config.properties``
      - Contains server configurable parameters such as URLs, paths, etc.
    * - ``services-context.xml``
      - Contains the bean definition for services layer
    * - ``rendering-context.xml``
      - Contains the bean definition for rendering
    * - ``logging.xml``
      - Contains loggers, appenders, etc.

These configuration files for Crafter Engine is located under  ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension``, where ``CRAFTER_HOME`` is the install directory of your CrafterCMS authoring or delivery environment.

The files can be accessed by opening the files using a text editor. Any changes made to any of the files listed above will require a restart of Crafter Engine.

.. _engine-root-folder:

""""""""""""""""""
Engine Root Folder
""""""""""""""""""
Crafter Engine requires a root folder path to be configured if the defaults are not used.

The default root folder path has the pattern: ``crafter.engine.site.default.rootFolder.path=file:${CRAFTER_DATA_DIR}/repos/sites/{siteName}/`` This relies on the ``CRAFTER_DATA_DIR`` environment variable being set. Crafter Engine will then resolve the ``{siteName}`` variable to the name of the site being requested.

To change the root folder path, you can either set the ``CRAFTER_DATA_DIR`` environment variable or change the default root folder path in the ``server-config.properties`` file (see more about that file in :ref:`server-config.properties <engine-configuration-files>`. The variable to modify is:

    .. code-block:: properties
      :caption: *{delivery-env-directory}/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*

.. _engine-turn-off-show-error:

"""""""""""""""""""
Turn Off Show Error
"""""""""""""""""""
Templates in CrafterCMS will display the errors in line with content as they encounter them to help the template developer during the coding process. On production environments, you do not want the errors to show up because it will highlight site issues and expose information that may be a security concern. To turn off showing errors in line with content, do the following:

#. Place the following property and value in the ``server-config.properties`` file

   .. code-block:: properties
       :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*

	   crafter.engine.template.error.displayInView=false

#. Restart the Crafter Engine application or the Tomcat service.

#. Test by deploying an FTL file with an error in it.
   Note that the error will not show up but is printed out in the server's log file.

.. _engine-http-response-headers:

"""""""""""""""""""""
HTTP Response Headers
"""""""""""""""""""""
CrafterCMS supports adding headers to responses when there are matched configuration patterns in
the Engine Project Configuration file |br|

To setup HTTP response headers, do the following:
- Configure the Ant path pattern to match for adding headers to response in **headerMappings.mapping.urlPattern**
- Configure the ``<header>`` element and the `<value>`` element ` with your desired values under **headerMappings.mapping.headers**.

.. code-block:: xml
    :emphasize-lines: 3, 6-7
    :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/SITENAME/sandbox/config/engine/site-config.xml*

    <headerMappings>
      <mapping>
        <urlPattern>/**/*.pdf</urlPattern>
        <headers>
          <header>
            <name>X-Crafter-Document</name>
            <value>true</value>
          </header>
        </headers>
      </mapping>
    </headerMappings>

.. _engine-cache-headers:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Setting Cache Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cache headers allows specifying caching policies such as how an item is cached, maximum age before expiring, etc.
These headers are extremely useful for indicating cache TTLs to CDNs and browsers on certain requests.

To setup cache headers, do the following:

- Configure the Ant path pattern to match for adding headers to response in **headerMappings.mapping.urlPattern**
- Configure the ``<header>`` element with the value ``Cache-Control`` and the element ``<value>`` with your desired Cache-Control
  directive under **headerMappings.mapping.headers**.

  See `here <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control>`__ for a list of available directives
  to use with ``Cache-Control``.

Your configuration should look something like below:

.. code-block:: xml
    :emphasize-lines: 3, 6-7
    :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/SITENAME/sandbox/config/engine/site-config.xml*

    <headerMappings>
      <mapping>
        <urlPattern>/articles/**</urlPattern>
        <headers>
          <header>
            <name>Cache-Control</name>
            <value>max-age=60\, s-maxage=300</value>
          </header>
        <headers>
      </mapping>
    </headerMappings>


Please note that the ``Cache-Control`` header inserted to responses by default is set to ``No-Cache``.

.. _engine-url-rewrite-configuration:

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Engine URL Rewrite Configuration
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
URL rewriting turns hard to remember, long and complicated URLs into easier to remember URLs.

CrafterCMS comes with the Tuckey URLRewrite filter, a Java Web Filter with functionality like Apache's mod_rewrite,
that lets you setup rewrite rules for your site.

To add a URL rewrite rule, in Studio, open the **Sidebar** then click on |projectTools|. Click on **Configuration**
then select **Engine URL Rewrite Configuration (XML Style)**.

The following section allows you to configure CORS headers in REST API responses when not in preview mode.

.. code-block:: xml

    (CORS Properties)
    <cors>

        (Values for each of the headers that will be added to responses)

        <accessControlAllowOrigin>*</accessControlAllowOrigin>
        <accessControlAllowMethods>GET\, OPTIONS</accessControlAllowMethods>
        <accessControlAllowHeaders>Content-Type</accessControlAllowHeaders>
        <accessControlAllowCredentials>true</accessControlAllowCredentials>
    </cors>

where:

- ``<enable>`` Enable/disable CORS headers, default is false.
  When enabled and the request is `preflight <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS#preflighted_requests_in_cors>`__,
  :ref:`preview token <preview-token>` validation is skipped.

- ``<accessControlAllowOrigin>`` values are split using ``,``. Remember that
  commas inside patterns need to be escaped with a ``\``,
  like this: ``<accessControlAllowOrigin>http://localhost:[8000\,3000],http://*.other.domain</accessControlAllowOrigin>``

- ``<accessControlAllowMethods>`` and ``<accessControlAllowHeaders>`` values are split using ``,``. Remember to escape the commas ``,`` separating
  the values like this: ``<accessControlAllowHeaders>X-Custom-Header\, Content-Type</accessControlAllowHeaders>`` or
  ``<accessControlAllowMethods>GET\, OPTIONS</accessControlAllowMethods>``

.. note::
    When engine is in preview mode, it is a proxy and therefore will not add CORS headers to REST API responses even if CORS is enabled.

Here's an example of using patterns in ``accessControlAllowOrigin``:

Proxy Configuration
"""""""""""""""""""
CrafterCMS supports a proxy system to proxy GraphQL, Engine, NodeJS or other application delivery systems. Whenever Crafter Engine receives a request, it is matched against the patterns of each server and the first match would then get the request sent to the server with the matching pattern. In some systems, multiple servers are used for search, Studio, etc. Using the proxy helps simplify the system.

One of the benefits of using the proxy in CrafterCMS is that it can connect to any remote server as the preview server, which allows for easier authoring of projects built with other programming languages and technology, React, Angular, or Vue for example.

The proxy configuration file contains configuration for the preview proxy servers.
To modify the proxy configuration, click on |projectTools| from the bottom of the *Sidebar*, then click on **Configuration** and select **Proxy Config** from the dropdown list.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proxy Example: React
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For example, you would like to work on a React application within Studio. What is normally included inside Studio is the build output of the React application, so that a user making edits to the React code would need to build the React code then copy it into Studio in order to preview the changes. This becomes cumbersome when developing, as many edits are normally done before reaching the final version of the React app. Using the proxy, the user can preview the React app in Studio and is able to work on both the React app and CrafterCMS.

Let's take a look at an example of setting up the proxy for a React application.

We'll look at the Video Center Blueprint, a React application available from the public marketplace, that runs on ``localhost:3000``, then setup the Studio proxy so we can preview the React application inside Studio. Finally, we'll make some changes in the React application and view the changes made inside Studio.

Let's begin:

#. Setup the React application.

   * Clone the video center blueprint by running ``git clone https://github.com/craftercms/video-center-blueprint.git``

       .. code-block:: sh

          ➜ git clone https://github.com/craftercms/video-center-blueprint.git
          Cloning into 'video-center-blueprint'...
          remote: Enumerating objects: 6433, done.
          remote: Total 6433 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 6433
          Receiving objects: 100% (6433/6433), 77.12 MiB | 4.92 MiB/s, done.
          Resolving deltas: 100% (4041/4041), done.

   * Run the React application

     Inside the video center blueprint folder that we just cloned above, navigate to ``video-center-blueprint/sources/app``.
     We need ``yarn`` installed in your system. Running ``yarn`` with no command will run ``yarn install``. In the example below, yarn is already installed in the system

       .. code-block:: sh
          :emphasize-lines: 1

          ➜  app git:(master) yarn
          yarn install v1.22.4
          [1/4] 🔍  Resolving packages...
          success Already up-to-date.
          ✨  Done in 0.68s.

     Build the React application by running ``yarn start``

       .. code-block:: sh
          :emphasize-lines: 1

          ➜  app git:(master) yarn start
            VITE v4.5.0  ready in 242 ms

            ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
            ➜  Network: http://192.168.1.8:3000/

            ➜  press h to show help

     The command above will open a browser window where we can view the app

     .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/vcbp-preview.webp
        :alt: Video Center Blueprint preview on "localhost:3000"
        :width: 70 %
        :align: center

     |

#. Setup Studio

   * Create a project using the video center blueprint from the Public Marketplace.

     From the **Main Menu**, click on **Project**, then click on the **Create Project** button. This will open the **Create Project** dialog. Look for **Video Center**, then click on the **Use** button, fill in the required information then click on the **Review** button, then finally the **Create Project** button. This **Video Center** blueprint we selected from the Marketplace is the same react application

     .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/vcbp-marketplace.webp
        :alt: Select Video Center blueprint from the Public Marketplace
        :width: 70 %
        :align: center

     |


   * Setup the proxy for the video center React application we started above

     Open the **Sidebar**, click on |projectTools|, then click on **Configuration**. Select **Proxy Config** from the dropdown menu.

     .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/config-open-proxy-config.webp
        :alt: Configurations - Open Proxy Configuration
        :width: 45%
        :align: center

     |

     Copy and paste the configuration below.  Scroll down to the ``preview`` server and notice that ``url`` points to the url used for the React application (``localhost:3000``) we setup in the beginning. Save your changes.

       .. code-block:: xml
          :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/sandbox/SITENAME/sandbox/config/engine/proxy-config.xml*
          :emphasize-lines: 27

          <proxy-config>
            <version>4.0.1</version>
            <servers>
              <server>
                <id>static-assets</id>
                <url />
                <patterns>

                  <pattern>/api/1/site/graphql.*</pattern>
                </patterns>
              </server>
              <server>
                <id>engine</id>
                <url />
                <patterns>
                  <pattern>/api/.*</pattern>
                </patterns>
              </server>
              <server>
                <id>preview</id>
                <url>http://localhost:3000</url>
                <patterns>
                  <pattern>.*</pattern>
                </patterns>
              </server>
            </servers>
          </proxy-config>

     For users running Studio on Docker, use ``http://host.docker.internal:3000`` for the ``url`` of the React application. Docker containers can access local services running on the host by connecting to ``host.docker.internal``. See https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds for more information on connecting from a container to a service on the host.

     At this point, the preview we are seeing in Studio should be the one from our React application.

   * Modify the React application then verify that we can preview the changes made inside Studio.

     For this part, we'll change the text ``Featured Channels`` in the home page to ``My Featured Channels``. Using your favorite editor, in your React app, navigate to ``video-center-blueprint/sources/app/src/containers/Home`` and open the ``Home.jsx`` file. Scroll down to the line with ``key: 'featured-channels'`` and edit the ``value``:

       .. code-block:: js
          :emphasize-lines: 3

          {
            key: 'featured-channels',
            value: 'My Featured Channels',
            type: 'channel-card-alt',
            ...

     Save your changes. Notice that in the React app preview (localhost:3000), the page is reloaded with our changes now visible. Now let's take a look at Studio. Notice that Studio preview has reloaded and the changes we made in the React app is now visible.

     .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/vcbp-react-app-edited.webp
        :alt: Changes made in the React app now visible in the Studio preview

        :align: center

     |

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proxy Example: Next.js
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let’s take a look at another example of setting up the proxy, this time for a Next.js application.

We’ll look at the Next.js Blueprint, a Next.js application available from the public marketplace, that runs on localhost:3000, then setup the Studio proxy so we can preview the Next.js application inside Studio. Finally, we’ll make some changes in the Next.js application and view the changes made inside Studio.

#. Setup Studio

   * Create a project using the Next.js blueprint from the Public Marketplace.

     From the **Main Menu**, click on **Project**, then click on the **Create Project** button. This will open the **Create Project** dialog. Look for **Next.js**, then click on the **Use** button, fill in the required information then click on the **Review** button, then finally the **Create Project** button. This **Next.js** blueprint we selected from the Marketplace contains the Next.js application that we will be proxying to Studio and the instructions for configuring the proxy.

     .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/nextjsbp-marketplace.webp
        :alt: Select Next.js blueprint from the Public Marketplace
        :width: 70 %
        :align: center

     |

   * Follow the instructions listed in the README to run the Next.js application

     .. code-block:: text

         1. In the CrafterCMS site sandbox directory, you'll find a directory called app, which is the Next.js app. Visit that directory on your terminal and run ``yarn``
         2. Create a copy of ``app/.env.local.example`` to produce ``app/.env.local``. If you named your project ``nextjs`` and CrafterCMS is running on ``localhost:8080``, no further edits are necessary; otherwise, change the file accordingly.
         3. Run ``yarn dev`` to start the node server on localhost:3000

     In your terminal, navigate to ``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/nextjs/sandbox/app`` then run ``yarn``

     .. code-block:: sh
          :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/nextjs/sandbox/app*

   * Setup the proxy for the Next.js application we started above

     .. code-block:: text

         4. Open Project Tools (on the sidebar on the left) and select "Configuration"
         5. Search for "Proxy Config"
         6. Comment line 58 and uncomment line 59
         7. Close the pop-up and refresh the page. You'll now see the next.js application in this area.

     Open the **Sidebar**, click on |projectTools|, then click on **Configuration**. Select **Proxy Config** from the dropdown menu.
     The proxy configuration included in the Next.js blueprint is very similar to the proxy configuration listed in the React example above. Comment line 58 and uncomment line 59 in the configuration:

     .. code-block:: xml
         :emphasize-lines: 3,4

         <server>
           <id>preview</id>
           <!--url/-->
           <url>http://localhost:3000</url>
           <patterns>
             <pattern>.*</pattern>
           </patterns>
         </server>

     After saving your changes in the configuration file, close the dialog and refresh the page. You will now see the next.js application inside Studio.

.. _engine-cache:

"""""
Cache
"""""
Crafter Engine sports a built-in cache engine with an LRU (least recently used) cache eviction policy. The cache is used to store an active set to help render content from memory whenever possible.

.. note:: When running in Preview Mode (inside Studio for preview purposes), Crafter Engine's cache is disabled to help authors see their changes immediately.

Engine has multiple caches:

.. version_tag::
    :label: Since
    :version: 4.3.1

- **application** cache for objects cached by Groovy code.
  It's enabled by specifying the value ``crafter.core.applicationCache`` in the ``SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`` env variable
  in the ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/crafter-setenv.sh`` file

  .. code-block:: sh
      :caption: *Example setting SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE in CRAFTER_HOME/bin/crafter-setenv.sh*

      # -------------------- Spring Profiles --------------------
      ...
      # Uncomment to enable application cache
      export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=crafter.core.applicationCache
      # For multiple active spring profiles, create comma separated list

  Active cache is only used in the application cache when the cache is enabled, if not enabled Engine behaves like in
  previous versions, with active cache running in the system cache.
- **system** cache for objects cached by Engine itself.
  The system cache is cleared by the Deployer on publish calling the API, when the Deployer runs alongside Engine.
  When Engine runs in serverless mode and detects a change in the ``deployment-events.properties`` file in S3, a new
  version of the system cache is built and the swapped with the old system cache version.

The ``system`` and ``application`` cache uses the same API to :base_url:`clear <_static/api/engine.html#tag/cache/operation/cacheClear>`
and to get :base_url:`statistics <_static/api/engine.html#tag/cache/operation/cacheStatistics>`, simply pass the parameter
``cacheType`` with either ``system`` or ``application`` value, depending on which cache you wish to clear or get statistics.

~~~~~~~~~
Max Items
~~~~~~~~~
The following allows you to configure the maximum number of objects in Engine's cache:

.. code-block:: properties
    :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*

    # The max number of items that each site cache can have
    crafter.engine.site.default.cache.maxAllowedItems=250000

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cache Warming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following allows you to configure items to be warmed up (preloaded) in the cache:

.. code-block:: properties
    :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*
    :emphasize-lines: 7,10,13

    #################
    # Cache Warm Up #
    #################
    # Indicates if cache warming should be enabled. This means the site cache will be warmed up (according to a list of
    # cache warmers) on context init and instead of cache clear, a new cache will be warmed up and switched with the
    # current one
    crafter.engine.site.cache.warmUp.enabled=false
    # The descriptor folders that need to be preloaded in cache, separated by comma. Specify the preload depth with
    # :{depth} after the path. If no depth is specified, the folders will be fully preloaded.
    crafter.engine.site.cache.warmUp.descriptor.folders=/site:3
    # The content folders that need to be preloaded in cache, separated by comma. Specify the preload depth with
    # :{depth} after the path. If no depth is specified, the folders will be fully preloaded.
    crafter.engine.site.cache.warmUp.content.folders=/scripts,/templates

where:

  - The descriptor folders are paths that contain XML that needs to be parsed, loaded and merged e.g. for inheritance.
    Most of the time this would be folders under ``/site``

  - The content folders are mostly static, non-processed content, e.g. scripts, templates, static-assets

For all projects, the cache is preloaded using the above configuration. CrafterCMS warms up the cache on every publish and startup. Note also that what's cache warmed will be warmed on every publish and startup and will live as long as nothing kicks it out of the cache due to least recently used (LRU) cache.

.. _engine-project-spring-configuration:

""""""""""""""""""""
Spring Configuration
""""""""""""""""""""
Each project can have it's own Spring application context. Just as with ``site-config.xml``, beans
can be overwritten using the following locations:

Spring Configuration Files
 - ``/config/engine/application-context.xml`` (This file can be accessed easily from any project created
   through the out-of-the-box blueprints, by navigating from the Studio sidebar to ``Project Tools``
   > ``Configuration``, and finally picking up the ``Engine Project Application Context`` option from the dropdown).

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/engine-project-application-context.webp
			 :alt: Engine Project Application Context

 - ``/config/engine/env/{envName}/application-context.xml``

The application context inherits from Engine's own service-context.xml, and any class in Engine's
classpath can be used, including Groovy classes declared under ``/scripts/classes/*``.

As an example, assuming you have defined a Groovy class under ``/scripts/classes/mypackage/MyClass.groovy``,
you can define a bean like this:

.. code-block:: xml
    :caption: */config/engine/application-context.xml*
    :linenos:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

        <bean class="org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer" parent="crafter.properties"/>

        <bean id="greeting" class="mypackage.MyClass">
            <property name="myproperty" value="${myvalue}"/>
        </bean>

    </beans>

A ``org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`` (like above) can be
specified in the context so that the properties of ``site-config.xml`` can be used as placeholders,
like ``${myvalue}``. By making the placeholder configurer inherit from crafter.properties, you'll
also have access to Engine's global properties (like ``crafter.engine.preview``).

.. note::
    Crafter Engine will not be able to load your Project Context if your context file contains invalid XML,
    incorrect configuration or if your beans do not properly handle their own errors on initialization.

.. _engine-mongodb-configuration:

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Configure Engine to use MongoDB
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
There are times when you may need access to MongoDB. This section details how you can access MongoDB by configuring Engine.

Here are the steps for configuring Engine to use mongoDB:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configure the MongoDB URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To define the connection between MongoDB and Engine, add the URI in the config file `/config/engine/site-config.xml`. (This file can be accessed easily from any project created through the out-of-the-box blueprints, by navigating from the Studio sidebar to Project Tools > Configuration, and finally picking up the **Engine Project Configuration** option from the dropdown).

.. code-block:: xml
    :caption: */config/engine/site-config.xml*

    <site>
      <db>
          <uri>mongodb://{host}:{port}/{database}?readPreference=primary&amp;maxPoolSize=50&amp;minPoolSize=5&amp;maxIdleTimeMS=1000&amp;waitQueueMultiple=200&amp;waitQueueTimeoutMS=100&amp;w=1&amp;journal=true</uri>
      </db>
    </site>

where:
   * {host} - required, server address to connect to
   * {port} - optional, with a default value of :27020 in CrafterCMS Authoring
   * {database} - optional, name of the database to authenticate if the connection string includes authentication credentials.

For more details on the Connection String URI format, see https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a GMongo Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To access Mongo from Groovy, we'll use a GMongo client. We'll need to add some beans in `/config/engine/application-context.xml`. (This file can be accessed easily from any project created through the out-of-the-box blueprints, by navigating from the Studio sidebar to Project Tools > Configuration, and finally picking up the **Engine Site Application Context** option from the dropdown).

.. code-block:: xml
    :caption: */config/engine/application-context.xml*
    :linenos:

    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

       <bean class="org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer" parent="crafter.properties"/>

       <bean id="mongoUri" class="com.mongodb.MongoClientURI">
         <constructor-arg value="${db.uri}"/>
       </bean>

       <bean id="mongoClient" class="com.gmongo.GMongoClient">
         <constructor-arg ref="mongoUri"/>
       </bean>

    </beans>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use the Client From a Groovy Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We can now use the client from a Groovy script. Here's a simple script that runs a query:

.. code-block:: groovy
    :linenos:

    def mongo = applicationContext.mongoClient
    def db = mongo.getDB("{database}")
    def result = null
    def record = db.{collection}.findOne(_id: "{some id}")
    if (record) {
        result = record.name
    }
    return result

where:
    * {database} - the name of an existing database
    * {collection} - collection name
    * {some id} - id you're searching for depending on your database

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Publish Configuration to Delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Until this point all changes have been made from Crafter Studio so they will only affect immediately
the authoring environment, for a delivery environment you will need to publish the changed files.

This can be done from the Studio project dashboard with the following steps:

1. Go to Studio's project dashboard via the Navigation Menu on the top right or via the Sidebar

   .. image:: /_static/images/content-author/project-dashboard-sidebar.webp
       :width: 65 %
       :align: center
       :alt: Studio - Project Dashboard from Sidebar

2. Locate the ``Unpublished Work`` dashlet

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/mongo/my-recent-activity.webp
      :alt: Studio Project Dashboard - My Recent Activity
      :width: 70 %
      :align: center

3. Select all configuration files updated in the previous sections

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/mongo/my-recent-activity-config.webp
      :alt: Studio Project Dashboard - My Recent Activity
      :width: 70 %
      :align: center

4. Click ``Publish`` from the contextual menu

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/mongo/approve-and-publish-context-menu.webp
      :alt: Studio Project Dashboard - Contextual Menu
      :width: 70 %
      :align: center

5. Click ``Publish`` to close the publish dialog

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/mongo/publish-dialog.webp
      :alt: Studio Project Dashboard - Publish Dialog
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

Once the files are deployed to the delivery node and the project context is reloaded the new
Configuration will take effect.

.. _engine-custom-properties:

""""""""""""""""""""""""
Engine Custom Properties
""""""""""""""""""""""""
Crafter Engine supports adding custom properties via the Engine Project Configuration file (``site-config.xml``).
This is useful when you want to add properties that are specific to your project.

To create a custom Engine property for use in your project, open the file in Studio by opening the Sidebar, then click
on |projectTools|, then ``Configuration``, then finally click on ``Engine Project Configuration``.

To add custom properties, simply add tags in the ``site-config.xml`` file using the name you want for your properties, as
shown below:

.. code-block:: xml
    :caption: */config/engine/site-config.xml*
    :emphasize-lines: 3-6

    <site>
      <version>4.0.1</version>
      <custom-properties>
        <custom-property-1>some_value</custom-property-1>
        <custom-property-2>some-other-value</custom-property-2>
      </custom-properties>
    </site>

All custom properties created in the Engine project configuration file are available in :ref:`Freemarker templates <templating-api>`
and :ref:`Groovy scripts <groovy-java-api>` using the ``siteConfig`` variable. The ``siteConfig`` variable is an instance of the
`XMLConfiguration <https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/XMLConfiguration.html>`__
class.

The main interface ``ImmutableConfiguration`` is used for accessing the custom property you created in a read-only fashion.
See https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/ImmutableConfiguration.html
for more information.

You can also access the custom property you created in the Engine Project Application Context (``application-context.xml``)
file like below, where ``myvalue`` is the custom property you created in the ``site-config.xml`` file:

.. code-block:: xml
    :caption: *config/engine/application-context.xml*
    :emphasize-lines: 7-9

    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

        <bean class="org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer" parent="crafter.properties"/>

        <bean id="greeting" class="mypackage.MyClass">
            <property name="myproperty" value="${myvalue}"/>
        </bean>

    </beans>

|

Let's take a look at an example of creating some custom properties and how to use them in a Groovy script.
We'll create the following properties in the Engine project configuration file ``site-config.xml``

- ``db.enabled`` a boolean
- ``db.url`` a string
- ``db.dbNames`` a list
- ``db.port`` an integer

.. code-block:: xml
    :caption: */config/engine/site-config.xml*

    <site>
      <version>4.0.1</version>
        <db>
          <enabled>true</enabled>
          <url>http://localhost:8080</url>
          <port>8080</port>
          <dbNames>db1,db2,db3</dbNames>
        </db>
    </site>

We'll now use the ``siteConfig`` variable to access the properties we created above using Groovy. We'll use a REST script
for our example, ``custom-properties.get.groovy``.

To get a string, use the ``getString`` method, which we'll use to get the value for ``db.url``:

.. code-block:: groovy
    :caption: *custom-properties.get.groovy - getString*

    return siteConfig.getString("db.url")

|

To get a list of strings, use the ``getStringArray`` method, which we'll use to get the value for ``db.dbNames``:

.. code-block:: groovy
    :caption: *custom-properties.get.groovy - getStringArray*

    return siteConfig.getStringArray("db.dbNames")

|

To get an integer, use the ``getInt`` method, which we'll use to get the value for ``db.port``:

.. code-block:: groovy
    :caption: *custom-properties.get.groovy - getInt*

    return siteConfig.getInt("db.port")

|

To get a boolean, use the ``getBoolean`` method, which we'll use to get the value for ``db.enabled``:

.. code-block:: groovy
    :caption: *custom-properties.get.groovy - getBoolean*

    return siteConfig.getBoolean("db.enabled")

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Creating a Custom Environment Example
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Let's take a look at an example of creating a new environment, called ``mycustomenv`` with the ``urlrewrite.xml``
file overridden in the new environment for a project created using the Website Editorial blueprint.  This example
is very similar to the example shown above for Studio except for the location of the custom configuration file:

#. We'll create a folder called ``env`` under ``data/repos/sites/my-editorial/sandbox/config/engine``

      .. code-block:: text
         :linenos:
         :emphasize-lines: 8

         data/
           repos/
             sites/
               my-editorial/
                 sandbox/
                   config/
                     engine/
                       env/

      |

#. Inside the ``env`` folder, create a directory called ``mycustomenv``
#. We will now create the configuration file for the ``urlrewrite.xml`` that we want to override in the new environment we are setting up, inside our ``mycustomenv`` folder:

   .. code-block:: text
       :emphasize-lines: 3

       env/
         mycustomenv/
           urlrewrite.xml

   |

   We will redirect the page to ``/articles/2021/12/Top Books For Young Women`` when the page ``/articles/2020/12/Top Books For Young Women`` is previewed. Copy the following inside the ``urlrewrite.xml`` file.

   .. code-block:: xml
       :linenos:
       :caption: *Urlrewrite.xml file for environment mycustomenv*

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
       <urlrewrite>
         <rule>
           <from>/articles/2020/12/(.*)$</from>
           <to type="redirect">/articles/2021/12/$1</to>
         </rule>
       </urlrewrite>

   |

   For our example, the folder ``articles/2020/12`` was copied to ``articles/2021`` with the page under ``articles/2021/12``, modified to display the title as a dupe. This was done so when we click on the page under ``articles/2020/12``, we can easily tell that it's being redirected to the page under ``articles/2021/12``. Of course, you can also just look at the url of the page previewed to verify that it was redirected to the right page.

#. Remember to commit the files copied so Studio will pick it up.

   .. code-block:: bash

       ➜  sandbox git:(master) ✗ git add .
       ➜  sandbox git:(master) ✗ git commit -m "Add urlrewrite.xml file for mycustomenv"

   |

#. Open the ``crafter-setenv.sh`` file in ``TOMCAT/bin`` and set the value of ``CRAFTER_ENVIRONMENT`` to the
   environment we setup above (*myenv*) to make it the active environment:

   .. code-block:: bash
       :caption: *bin/crafter-setenv.sh*

       # -------------------- Configuration variables --------------------
       export CRAFTER_ENVIRONMENT=${CRAFTER_ENVIRONMENT:=mycustomenv}

   |

#. Restart Crafter. To verify our newly setup environment, open the ``Sidebar`` and click on |projectTools|, then select ``Configuration``. Notice that the active environment ``mycustomenv`` will be displayed on top of the configurations drop-down box and when you select the *Engine URL Rewrite Configuration (XML Style)*, it should display the file we created in one of the previous step:

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/env-custom-configurations.webp
      :align: center
      :alt: Active Environment Displayed in Project Tools Configuration

   |

   Let's verify that our *urlrewrite.xml* is in effect. From the *Sidebar*, click on *Home* -> *Entertainment* -> *Top Books For Young Women*  or, navigate to */articles/2020/12/* and click on *Top Books For Young Women*.

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/env-preview-page.webp

   The preview page should take you to */articles/2021/12/Top Books For Young Women*

Environment Specific Configurations Example
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Environments are useful for managing values such as paths or database connections without the need to
change any code directly in the servers.

In this example, we show how to manage a database connection that will change depending on the server
where the project is deployed. We will have three environments ``dev``, ``auth`` and ``delivery``

#. First create the environments by following the example above for creating the environments.
   We'll then have the following folders called ``dev``, ``auth`` and ``delivery`` under ``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/SITENAME/sandbox/config/engine/env``

#. Next, include the appropriate connection string for each environment in the ``site-config.xml`` file:

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *Local Development Configuration: /config/engine/env/dev/site-config.xml*
      :linenos:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <site>
        <db>
          <uri>mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb?maxPoolSize=1&amp;minPoolSize=0&amp;maxIdleTimeMS=10000</uri>
        </db>
      </site>


   .. code-block:: xml
       :caption: *Authoring Configuration: /config/engine/env/auth/site-config.xml*
       :linenos:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <site>
         <db>
           <uri>mongodb://localhost:27020/mydb?maxPoolSize=5&amp;minPoolSize=2&amp;maxIdleTimeMS=10000</uri>
         </db>
       </site>


   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *Delivery Configuration: /config/engine/env/delivery/site-config.xml*
      :linenos:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <site>
        <db>
          <uri>mongodb://delivery-db-server:27020/delivery-db?maxPoolSize=10&amp;minPoolSize=5&amp;maxIdleTimeMS=1000</uri>
        </db>
      </site>

   Remember to commit the files copied so Studio will pick it up.

#. Finally, notice when using this approach the code is completely independent of the environment so we only need one
   bean that will always connect to the right database:

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *Default Application Context: /config/engine/application-context.xml (shared by all environments)*
      :linenos:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Engine Multi-target Support
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
There are some cases where the Engine configuration files need to have different values per publishing target. Say for a production environment where you have **staging** to test out your project and **live** , the project to be used by end users, you may need different SAML authentication mechanics or different URL rewrites.

The :ref:`engine-multi-environment-support` section detailed how to setup Engine configuration files per environment. CrafterCMS
supports overriding Engine configuration files, not just per environment, but also per publishing target.
It supports a base configuration per environment with the ability to override per publishing target.

The following engine configuration files can be setup for different publishing targets:

* site-config.xml
* application-context.xml
* urlrewrite.xml

Here are the available publishing targets for the configuration files listed above:

* preview
* staging
* live

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overriding Engine Configuration Files per Publishing Target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To override a configuration file in any of the publishing targets

#. Add the new configuration file/s for overriding to **Configurations** under |projectTools| -> **Configuration**

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/configuration.webp
      :alt: Multi-target Configuration - Open Configurations
      :width: 45 %
      :align: center

   |

   The overriding configuration file should be named **configuration-to-be-overridden.publishing-target.xml**. Depending on the publishing target you wish the configuration file to override, the files should look like one of the following:

   - *configuration-to-be-overridden.preview.xml*
   - *configuration-to-be-overridden.staging.xml*
   - *configuration-to-be-overridden.live.xml*

   |

   Say, to add a ``urlrewrite.xml`` file override for **staging**, add the following in the **Configurations**

Example
'''''''

Let's take a look at an example of overriding the Project Configuration used by Engine ``site-config.xml`` for the **staging** and **live** publishing targets so that each target has a different SAML authentication mechanics (different identity provider in ``staging`` and ``live``). In our example, we will use a project created using the Website Editorial blueprint named **mysite**

#. Add the new configuration file/s for overriding to **Configurations** under |projectTools| -> **Configuration**. We will be overriding the ``site-config.xml`` file in the **staging** and **live** publishing targets, so we will add to the configuration a ``site-config.staging.xml`` and ``site-config.live.xml`` files.

When developing templates or scripts only a small list of services are available to use. You can expose other
services with the following steps.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CrafterCMS Services

If your project/site includes a custom application context with services, you can make them available by adding them to the
comma-separated list in the :ref:`server-config.properties <engine-configuration-files>` configuration file:

  crafter.engine.defaultPublicBeans=crafter\\.(targetIdManager|targetedUrlStrategy),someOtherBean

.. note:: The value from the configuration is used as a regular expression, if the value contains special
          characters you will need to escape them with backslashes ``\\``.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
System Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. warning:: This setting will disable restrictions for all projects/sites

System objects like ``servletContext`` cannot be exposed by adding them to a list, instead you will need to change
the following configuration in the :ref:`server-config.properties <engine-configuration-files>` file:

If your Groovy code need to use external dependencies you can use Grapes, however, when the Groovy sandbox is enabled
dependencies can only be downloaded during the initial compilation and not during runtime. For this reason it is
required to add an extra parameter ``initClass=false`` in the annotations to prevent them to be copied to the classes:

Crafter Engine can be configured to support SAML2 SSO out of the box without using any additional plugin.

#. A SAML2 compatible Identity Provider properly configured, this configuration will not be covered here
#. A private key and certificate. This can be generated like so:

    ``openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout rp-private.key -x509 -days 365 -out rp-certificate.crt``

    Take note of the values of the following options used to generate your key and certificate that will be
    used later for configuring Crafter Engine:

    * **keyout**: The value used for this option wil be used in the ``crafter.security.saml.rp.privateKey.location`` property
    * **out**: The value used for this option will be used in the ``crafter.security.saml.rp.certificate.location`` property

""""""""""""""""""""""""
Update the Configuration
""""""""""""""""""""""""
To configure Engine SAML2, in your Delivery installation, we need to enable SAML security then we'll setup the required SAML configuration properties.

To enable SAML security, go to ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin``, open the ``crafter-setenv.sh`` file and uncomment the line ``export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=crafter.engine.samlSecurity``:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/crafter-setenv.sh*

   # -------------------- Spring Profiles --------------------
   ...
   # Uncomment to enable SAML security
   export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=crafter.engine.samlSecurity
   # For multiple active spring profiles, create comma separated list

|

Next we'll setup SAML configuration properties. Go to ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension`` and add/uncomment the following lines to :ref:`server-config.properties <engine-config>` (of course, make any appropriate configuration changes according to your system):

Restart your installation after configuring the above.

You should now be able to test the SAML2 authentication and if there are no configuration or
communication errors you will be redirected to the SSO login page when trying to access a
secured page and then automatically return to your project in Crafter Engine.

.. note::
  If you are configuring SAML2 authentication in an authoring environment, you need to make sure that your IDP is
  configured to allow the login to be displayed in an ``iframe`` element by setting the right values for the
  ``Content-Security-Policy`` header. You can find more information
  `here <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy>`__.

.. _engine-headers-authentication:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Configure Headers Based Authentication |enterpriseOnly|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Crafter Engine is able to integrate with any authentication system that sends custom HTTP headers containing
information that will be used to authenticate the user in Engine. This section details how to setup Engine for
headers based authentication.

To enable Engine headers based authentication:

- Set ``security.headers.standalone`` to ``true``
- Set the URLs requiring authentication

Additionally, optional role mappings are available that allows mapping names from the external authentication to
simple role names to use in the page or URL restrictions. Optional attribute mappings are also available which
allow exposing attributes from the external authentication authority.

To enable Engine headers based authentication, open the Engine project configuration file ``site-config.xml``.

Set ``security.headers.standalone`` to ``true``

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *Engine Project Configuration  - Enable headers authentication*
      :emphasize-lines: 4

      <security>
        ...
        <headers>
          <standalone>true</standalone>
        </headers>
      </security>

   |

Next, configure the URLs you require authentication by setting ``url`` to desired value and ``expression`` to
``isAuthenticated()`` like below:

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *Engine Project Configuration  - setup url restrictions*
      :emphasize-lines: 3-6

      <security>
        <urlRestrictions>
          <restriction>
            <url>/**</url>
            <expression>isAuthenticated()</expression>
          </restriction>
        </urlRestrictions>
        ...
      </security>

   |

See :ref:`engine-project-security-guide-restrict-urls` for more information on expressions that can be used.

From the above configuration, here are the headers that Engine expects to be provided:

- ``CRAFTER_secure_key`` (required)
- ``CRAFTER_username`` (required)
- ``CRAFTER_email`` (required)
- ``CRAFTER_groups``
- ``CRAFTER_*``

It is also possible to change the prefix and names for the headers:

.. code-block:: xml
   :caption: *Engine Project Configuration  - change default header names*
   :linenos:

   <security>
     <headers>
       ...
       <names>
        <!-- Prefix that will be used for all headers, defaults to 'CRAFTER_' -->
        <prefix>MY_APP_</prefix>

        <!-- Name for the header containing the username, defaults to 'username' -->
        <username>user</username>

        <!-- Name for the header containing the email, defaults to 'email' -->
        <email>address</email>

        <!-- Name for the header containing the groups, defaults to 'groups' -->
        <groups>roles</groups>

        <!-- Name for the header containing the token, defaults to 'secure_key' -->
        <token>verification</token>

       </names>
       ...
     </headers>
   </security>

|

.. note::
    For CrafterCMS versions prior to 3.1.14, the prefix for the headers is ``MELLON_`` and can't be changed via project configuration


The default value of the token is ``my_secure_token``. Remember to replace the default value by setting
``security.headers.token`` to secure your installation. In the example below, the token is now set to
``CHANGE_MY_TOKEN_VALUE``

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *Engine Project Configuration  - Change the default value of the token*

            </attribute>
          </attributes>
          ...
        </headers>
      </security>


*where:*

* **name**: The name of the attribute in the header, with the prefix removed. (if your prefix is ``CRAFTER_`` then the
  header value would be ``CRAFTER_APP_ATTRIBUTE_NAME``, and you should enter ``APP_ATTRIBUTE_NAME`` in this tag.)
* **field**: The name of the attribute that will be created in the authentication object.

To get the value of the attribute passed in the header, use the following ``authToken.principal.attributes.name``,
 where ``name`` is the name of the attribute in the authentication object.

"""""""
Example
"""""""
Let's take a look at an example of setting up Engine headers authentication using a project created using the Website
Editorial blueprint named ``My Editorial``. We will also change the default value for the token header. We'll then take a
look at an example of setting up Engine headers authentication with optional role mappings and attribute.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Simple Example Setting Up Engine Headers Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open the Engine ``site-config.xml`` file in Studio, by navigating from the ``Sidebar`` to
``Project Tools`` > ``Configuration``, and finally picking up the ``Engine Project Configuration`` option from the list.

You can also access the ``site-config.xml`` using your favorite editor under
``CRAFTER_HOME/data/repos/sites/SITENAME/sandbox/config/engine/site-config.xml``

Add the following, where we are enabling Engine headers authentication and requiring authentication for all URLs in the
project in addition to changing the default value for the token to ``my_updated_token``. :

   .. code-block:: xml
      :caption: *Engine Project Configuration  - Example enabling headers authentication*

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <site>
        <version>2</version>
        <security>
          <urlRestrictions>
            <restriction>
              <url>/**</url>
              <expression>isAuthenticated()</expression>
            </restriction>
          </urlRestrictions>
          <headers>
            <standalone>true</standalone>
            <token>my_updated_token</token>
          </headers>
        </security>
      </site>

Save your changes and remember to publish the file ``/config/engine/site-config.xml`` to see the Engine headers
authentication in action in delivery.

Now, try viewing the Home page without the header attributes required, by entering in your browser
``localhost:9080?crafterSite=my-editorial``. The Home page will not be displayed without the required header attributes.

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/engine-headers-delivery-not-sent.webp
   :align: center
   :width: 75%
   :alt: Website Editorial Home Page view without the headers sent

|

This time, try viewing the Home page with the following header attributes and values:

- ``CRAFTER_secure_key``: my_updated_token
- ``CRAFTER_username``: jsmith
- ``CRAFTER_email``: jsmith@example.com

You should now see the Home page displayed

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/engine-headers-delivery-sent.webp
   :align: center
   :width: 75%
   :alt: Website Editorial Home Page view with the headers sent

See :ref:`engine-config` for more information on how to access the ``site-config.xml`` file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example Setting Up Engine Headers Authentication with Optional Role Mappings and Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We'll now take a look at another example where we setup optional role mappings and attributes.

We'll setup the ``admin`` and the ``user`` roles and add the attribute ``APP_FULL_NAME``. We'll try to restrict
access to ``/articles/**`` for users with the ``user`` or ``admin`` role, then we'll try to display the
``APP_FULL_NAME`` value passed from the headers in our project. Remember that the ``ROLE_`` prefix is required

Open the Engine ``site-config.xml`` file in Studio, by navigating from the ``Sidebar`` to
``Project Tools`` > ``Configuration``, and finally picking up the ``Engine Project Configuration`` option from the dropdown.

Add the following to setup the ``admin`` and ``user`` role, and the attribute ``APP_FULL_NAME``:

.. code-block:: xml
    :caption: *Engine Project Configuration  - Example Engine headers authentication with optional role mappings and attribute*
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 5, 13-22, 24-29

    <security>
      <urlRestrictions>
        <restriction>
          <url>/articles/**</url>
          <expression>hasAnyRole('user'\,'admin')</expression>
        </restriction>
      </urlRestrictions>
      <headers>
        <standalone>true</standalone>
        <token>my_updated_token</token>
        <!-- Optional role mappings, allows to map names from the external auth to simple role names to use in the page or url restrictions -->
        <!-- The APP_ prefix is just an example, the values can be anything -->
        <!-- The ROLE_ prefix is is required for the name of the role -->
        <groups>
          <group>
            <name>APP_ADMIN</name> <!-- The name of the group in the header -->
            <role>ROLE_admin</role>     <!-- The name of the role in the authentication object -->
          </group>
          <group>
            <name>APP_USER</name> <!-- The name of the group in the header -->
            <role>ROLE_user</role>     <!-- The name of the role in the authentication object -->
          </group>
        </groups>
        <!-- Optional attribute mappings, allows to expose attributes from the external auth -->
        <attributes>
          <attribute>
            <name>APP_FULL_NAME</name> <!-- The name of the attribute in the header -->
            <field>name</field>        <!-- The name of the attribute in the authentication object -->
          </attribute>
        </attributes>
      </headers>
    </security>

|

For the ``expression`` in the URL restriction, remember to escape the comma as shown above
``<expression>hasAnyRole('user'\,'admin')</expression>``

When we send the following headers:

- ``CRAFTER_secure_key``: my_updated_token
- ``CRAFTER_username``: jsmith
- ``CRAFTER_email``: jsmith@example.com

Notice that when we try to view an article, since the user does not have either ``admin`` or ``user`` role, the page
is not available and will display the following message: ``The user doesn't have enough rights to access the page.``
In our example below, we tried previewing the article ``Top Books For Young Women`` with the headers listed above and
is shown the message below:

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/engine-headers-no-role.webp
   :align: center
   :width: 75%
   :alt: Website Editorial Article Page view without the proper role for the user

|


Let's now try sending the headers again, but this time with the role ``APP_USER`` for our user

- ``CRAFTER_secure_key``: my_updated_token
- ``CRAFTER_username``: jsmith
- ``CRAFTER_email``: jsmith@example.com
- ``CRAFTER_groups``: APP_USER

Notice that this time, we are able to preview the article correctly

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/engine-headers-w-role.webp
   :align: center
   :width: 75%
   :alt: Website Editorial Article Page view without the proper role for the user

|


The website editorial blueprint displays the value of the attribute with field ``name`` out of the box in the page
header. You can take a look at the ``header.ftl`` file on how the attribute is displayed. Open the ``Sidebar`` in
Studio, then navigate to ``/templates/web/components/`` then right click on ``header.ftl`` and select ``Edit``.
The ``authToken.principal.attributes.name`` contains the value passed for ``APP_FULL_NAME`` in the header

.. code-block:: text
    :emphasize-lines: 5-6
    :caption: */templates/web/components/header.ftl*
    :linenos:

    <#import "/templates/system/common/cstudio-support.ftl" as studio />

      <a href="/" class="logo"><img border="0" alt="${contentModel.logo_text_t!""}" src="${contentModel.logo_s!""}">
        <#if (authToken.principal)??>
          <#assign name = authToken.principal.attributes.name!"stranger" />
        <#else>
          <#assign name = "stranger" />
        </#if>

        Howdy, ${name}

       </a>
       ...
    </header>

|

Let's now try sending the headers again, but this time with the attribute ``APP_FULL_NAME``

- ``CRAFTER_secure_key``: my_updated_token
- ``CRAFTER_username``: jsmith
- ``CRAFTER_email``: jsmith@example.com
- ``CRAFTER_groups``: APP_USER
- ``CRAFTER_APP_FULL_NAME``: John Smith

Note that when sending the attribute ``APP_FULL_NAME`` in the header, the header prefix must be added as shown above.

When we preview a page, the value in the custom header is displayed:

.. _setup-cloudfront-signed-cookies-in-crafter:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Setup CloudFront Signed Cookies in CrafterCMS Delivery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
One way to provide access to restricted content through AWS CloudFront is to use signed cookies.
This section details how to setup CloudFront signed cookies for CrafterCMS with SSO.

From the  `AWS documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-signed-cookies.html>`__

.. code-block:: text

      CloudFront signed cookies allow you to control who can access your content when you don't want to change your
      current URLs or when you want to provide access to multiple restricted files, for example, all of the files
      in the subscribers' area of a website.

Here are the steps:

1. Configure CloudFront to use signed cookies following this guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-signed-cookies.html
2. Add the Groovy class to your site's classes.

   .. literalinclude:: /_static/code/system-admin/CloudFrontUtils.groovy
      :language: groovy
      :caption: CloudFrontUtils.groovy
      :linenos:

3. Create a Groovy filter that checks for current user authentication/authorization on the requests that need it, and then calls the class method: ``CloudFrontUtils.setSignedCookies(request, response, siteConfig)``
4. Add the following config to Engine's site-config.xml:

   .. code-block:: xml
      :linenos:

      <aws>
        <cloudFront>
          <signedCookies>
            <domain><!--- Site's domain name, used by CloudFront --></domain>
            <resourcePath>static-assets/*</resourcePath>
            <keyPairId encrypted=""><!-- ID of the key pair created in step 1, recommended to be encrypted with Encrypt Marked from the UI  --></keyPairId>
            <privateKey encrypted=""><!-- Content of the private key created in step 1, recommended to be encrypted with Encrypt Marked from the UI</privateKey>
            <cloudFrontTimeToExpire><!--Time in minutes after which CloudFront will not allow access to the content using the cookie --></cloudFrontTimeToExpire>
            <cookieMaxAge><!-- Time in minutes after which the browser will consider the cookie expired --></cookieMaxAge>
          </signedCookies>
        </cloudFront>
      </aws>

   |

5. Configure an Error Page HTML in CloudFront for 403 errors, that will redirect to Engine using JS so that the SSO flow is started. It can be like the following:

   .. code-block:: html

      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <!-- saved from url=(0014)about:internet -->
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          ...
          <script>
            if(document.location.hash.indexOf("dlink") == -1) {
              document.location = "/auth-asset?a=" + document.location.pathname + "#dlink";
            }
          </script>
          ...
        </head>
        <main id="main-content">
          <!-- PAGE CONTENT -->
          <script>
            if(document.location.hash.indexOf("dlink") != -1) {
              document.getElementById("headline").innerHTML = "403";
              document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "You do not have permissions to access the requested resource. You will be redirected to the home page momentarily.";
              setTimeout(function(){ document.location = "/" }, 5000);
            }
          </script>
      </body></html>

   |

6. Create a ``/auth-asset`` page in your site with a Groovy script that only redirects back to the asset (the auth and cookie should have been already setup by filters):

   .. code-block::

      if(params.a) {
        response.sendRedirect(params.a)
      }

.. _engine-project-security-guide:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Engine Project Security Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following guide will help you configure Crafter Engine to:

#. Add authentication for your project.
#. Add authorization so that access to certain pages and URLs of your project are restricted.

Crafter Engine is able to integrate with multiple authentication providers:

#. **Using SAML2**

   To configure SAML 2.0, follow the instructions: :ref:`engine-saml2-configuration`

#. **Using Crafter Profile**

   To configure Crafter Profile, follow the instructions: :ref:`engine-crafter-profile-configuration`

""""""""""""""""""
Add Authentication
""""""""""""""""""
~~~~~~~~~
Add Login
~~~~~~~~~
To add a login page:

#. In Crafter Studio, create a Home > Login page.
#. The page template should contain a form that POSTs to /crafter-security-login, sending the ``username``,
    ``password`` and ``rememberMe`` parameters, like in the following snippet:

   .. code-block:: html
     :linenos:

     <form action="/crafter-security-login" method="post">
         <label for="username">Username: </label>
         <input type="text" name="username"/>
         <br/>
         <label for="password">Password: </label>
         <input type="password" name="password"/>
         <br/>
         <input type="checkbox" name="rememberMe" value="true">Remember Me</input>
         <br/>
         <button type="submit">Sign in</button>
     </form>

~~~~~~~~~~
Add Logout
~~~~~~~~~~
To add logout, just add a link in the global header that points to /crafter-security-logout:

.. code-block:: html
 :linenos:

 <a href="/crafter-security-logout">Log Out</a>

"""""""""""""""""
Add Authorization
"""""""""""""""""
Adding authorization allows restricted access to certain pages and URLs of your project depending on what is setup.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Restrict Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can restrict pages based on whether a user is authenticated or has a certain role. To do this, you need to follow
the next steps to create in the page content type a Repeating Group with a text Input for the roles:

#. In Studio, click on |projectTools|.
#. Click on **Content Types** then **Open Existing Type** and select the content type for the pages that you want to restrict.
#. On Controls, select the Repeating Group and add it to any Form Section (you can even create an Authorization section just for these fields).
#. In the Repeating Group properties, set the **Title** field to "Authorized Roles" and the **Name / Variable Name** field to "authorizedRoles."

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/authorized_roles_properties.webp
       :alt: Engine Project Security Guide - Authorized Roles Properties

   |

   .. warning::
       The UI autofills the **Name/ Variable Name** field and adds postfixes as you're typing in the **Title** field. Remember to remove the postfix ``_o``, as ``authorizedRoles`` is a reserved variable name used by CrafterCMS. For a list of variable names used by CrafterCMS, see :ref:`form-control-variable-names` for more information

       The ``ROLE_`` prefix is optional for values in ``authorizedRoles``

#. Add an Input control inside the Repeating Group, with the **Title** field set to "Role" and the **Name / Variable Name** field set to "role". Make this Input required by checking the checkbox under **Constraints** in the **Required** field in the **Properties Explorer**.

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/role_properties.webp
       :alt: Engine Project Security Guide - Role Properties

   |

   .. warning::
       The UI autofills the **Name / Variable Name** field and adds postfixes as you're typing in the **Title** field. Remember to remove the postfix ``_o``, as the ``role`` variable name is used by CrafterCMS for enforcing access to a page. For a list of variable names used by CrafterCMS, see :ref:`form-control-variable-names` for more information


#. Save the changes. The added fields should look like this:

   .. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/authorization_section.webp
       :alt: Engine Project Security Guide - Authorization Section

   |

With these changes, now you or any other content author can go to any page of this content type and add the roles that
are required to access the page. Two special roles which indicate authentication state can be used besides the roles
that are included in user profiles: ``Anonymous`` and ``Authenticated``. The complete access check algorithm executed
by Crafter Engine is described below:

#. If the page doesn't contain any role, no authentication is needed.
#. If the page has the role ``Anonymous``, no authentication is needed.
#. If the page has the role ``Authenticated``, just authentication is needed.
#. If the page has any other roles, the user needs to be authenticated and have any of those roles.

.. _engine-project-security-guide-restrict-urls:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Restrict URLs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes it is not enough to restrict a single page. Sometimes you need to restrict an entire project subtree, or
restrict several static assets. For this, CrafterCMS provides configuration parameters that allow you to restrict
access based on URL patterns. You just need to add configuration similar to the following in Config > Engine Project Configuration:

.. code-block:: xml
    :linenos:

    <security>
        <urlRestrictions>
            <restriction>
                <url>/user/*</url>
                <expression>hasAnyRole({'user'\, 'admin'})</expression>
            </restriction>
        </urlRestrictions>
    </security>

The ``<urlRestrictions>`` can contain any number of ``<restriction>`` elements. Each restriction is formed by an
Ant-style path pattern (``<url>``) and a Spring EL expression (``<expression>``) executed against the current profile.
If a request matches the URL, and the expression evaluates to false, access is denied. The following expressions can
be used:

*   ``isAnonymous()``
*   ``isAuthenticated()``
*   ``hasRole('role')``
*   ``hasAnyRole({'role1'\, 'role2'})``
*   ``permitAll()``
*   ``denyAll()``

.. note::
   For the ``<url>`` Ant-style path pattern, ``<url>/*</url>`` indicates just one level of the URL and ``<url>/**</url>`` indicates all urls. For more information on Ant-style path pattern matching, see https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/AntPathMatcher.html

   For the ``hasAnyRole`` expression, remember to escape the comma ``,`` separating the roles inside the expression as shown above.

   For more information, check
   :javadoc_base_url:`UrlAccessRestrictionCheckingProcessor.java <profile/org/craftercms/security/processors/impl/UrlAccessRestrictionCheckingProcessor.html>`
   and :javadoc_base_url:`AccessRestrictionExpressionRoot.java <profile/org/craftercms/security/utils/spring/el/AccessRestrictionExpressionRoot.html>`

.. _engine-security-access-attributes:

""""""""""""""""""""""
Access User Attributes
""""""""""""""""""""""
Once the authentication and authorization configurations are completed you can use the ``authToken`` object in
templates and scripts to access the current user attributes. The class of the object will change depending of the
authentication provider used, but you can always obtain an instance of |CustomUser| using the ``principal`` property.

.. code-block:: none
  :caption: Displaying the first name of the current user in Freemarker

  <#if authToken??>
    Hello ${authToken.principal.attributes.firstName}!
  <#else>
    <#-- show login button -->
  </#if>

.. note:: You can find more details about the ``authToken`` variable in :ref:`templating-api` or :ref:`groovy-java-api`

|

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Migrating from Crafter Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prior to version ``3.1.5`` Crafter Profile was the only security provider available, all projects created in previous
versions will continue to work without any changes, however if you need to migrate to a different provider like SAML2
you will need to replace all uses of the ``profile`` and ``authentication`` variables, both have been replaced with
``authToken``.

In templates and scripts you can replace all uses of ``profile`` with ``authToken`` and ``profile.attributes`` with
``authToken.principal.attributes``.

.. note:: Some advanced uses like custom security filters will need to be updated to integrate with Spring Security


|

.. important::
    **The variables** ``profile`` **and** ``authentication`` **will be null in most cases and should not be used anymore**


.. |CustomUser| replace:: :javadoc_base_url:`CustomUser <engine/org/craftercms/engine/util/spring/security/CustomUser.html>`

.. _engine-crafter-profile-configuration:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Engine Crafter Profile Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. note:: This guide includes Crafter Profile specific configuration only, for a general guide see
          :ref:`engine-project-security-guide`

Crafter Engine needs access tokens to use Crafter Profile's API. Each project must have it's own access token. Follow the
next steps to create one:

#. Login to Crafter Profile Admin Console as a ``PROFILE_SUPERADMIN`` (by default the admin user has this role). *See* :ref:`here <crafter-profile-admin-console>` *for more information on the Crafter Profile Admin Console UI.*
#. Click on **New Access Token** in the navigation. Enter your project's name on **Application**, leave the **Master** checkbox
   unselected, pick a proper Expiration Date (10 years from the current date is ok) and on **Tenant Permissions** add
   your tenant's name to the input (*Remember that your tenant's name has to have the same name as your project. See the note below*) and click on **Add**. By default the admin console auto-selects the 3 actions
   mentioned before. If you're using the same access token as another environment (e.g. you want to use the same
   access token in dev and prod), copy the same access token ID from the other environment, and enter the same field
   values for Application, Master and Expiration Date. Finally, click on **Accept**.

   .. note::
       Authentication by default is done against a tenant with the same name as your project. See :ref:`profile-admin-tenants` for more information on creating a tenant.

       :width: 65%

   |

#. Now that you have created the access token, you need to "tell" Engine to use it in your project. In Admin Console,
    click on **List Access Tokens** in the navigation menu and copy the ID of the token you just created. Then, depending
    on the mode Engine is running, add one of the following configurations (preview is ignored because normally
    predefined Personas are used, so there's no need to access the Crafter Profile app).

    .. code-block:: xml

    Normally, to add registration or sign up you just need to:

    #. Create a page with an HTML form that captures the user information for registration:

        .. code-block:: html
          :linenos:

          <form action="/registration" method="post">
              Email: <input type="text" name="email"></input><br/>
              First Name: <input type="text" name="firstname"></input><br/>
              Last Name: <input type="text" name="lastname"></input><br/>
              Password: <input type="password" name="password"></input><br/>
              <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>

    #. Create a controller script that receives the information and creates the respective profile. Assuming the
        controller should be under /registration, you need to create a script under Scripts > controllers >
        registration.post.groovy, with code similar to the following:

        .. code-block:: groovy
          :linenos:

          import utils.MailHelper

          import org.craftercms.engine.exception.HttpStatusCodeException
          import org.craftercms.profile.api.Profile
          import org.craftercms.security.utils.SecurityUtils

          def sendVerificationEmail(mailHelper, profile) {
              def token = profileService.createVerificationToken(profile.id.toString())
              def verificationUrl = urlTransformationService.transform("toFullUrl", "/verifyacct?token=${token.id}")
              def model = [:]
                  model.profile = profile
                  model.verificationUrl = verificationUrl

              mailHelper.sendEmail("noreply@example.com", profile.email, "Verify Account", "/templates/mail/verify-account.ftl", model)
          }

          def email = params.email
          def firstName = params.firstname
          def lastName = params.lastname
          def password = params.password

          if (!email) {
              throw new HttpStatusCodeException(400, "Bad request: missing email")
          } else if (!firstName) {
              throw new HttpStatusCodeException(400, "Bad request: missing first name")
          } else if (!lastName) {
              throw new HttpStatusCodeException(400, "Bad request: missing last name")
          } else if (!password) {
              throw new HttpStatusCodeException(400, "Bad request: missing password")
          }

          def profile = profileService.getProfileByUsername(siteContext.siteName, email)
          if (profile == null) {
              def attributes = [:]
                  attributes.firstName = firstName
                  attributes.lastName = lastName

              profile = profileService.createProfile(siteContext.siteName, email, password, email, false, null, attributes, null)

              sendVerificationEmail(new MailHelper(siteContext.freeMarkerConfig.configuration), profile)

              return "redirect:/"
          } else {
              throw new HttpStatusCodeException(400, "User '${email}' already exists")
          }

    #. Create also a MailHelper.groovy file under Classes > groovy > utils, with the following code:

        .. code-block:: groovy
          :linenos:

          package utils

          import java.util.Properties

          import org.craftercms.commons.mail.impl.EmailFactoryImpl
          import org.craftercms.engine.exception.HttpStatusCodeException
          import org.springframework.mail.javamail.JavaMailSenderImpl

          class MailHelper {

              def emailFactory

              def MailHelper(freeMarkerConfig) {
                  def javaMailProperties = new Properties()
                      javaMailProperties["mail.smtp.auth"] = "false"
                    javaMailProperties["mail.smtp.starttls.enable"] = "false"

                  def mailSender = new JavaMailSenderImpl()
                      mailSender.host = "localhost"
                      mailSender.port = 25
                      mailSender.protocol = "smtp"
                      mailSender.defaultEncoding = "UTF-8"
                      mailSender.javaMailProperties = javaMailProperties

                  emailFactory = new EmailFactoryImpl()
                  emailFactory.mailSender = mailSender
                  emailFactory.freeMarkerConfig = freeMarkerConfig
              }

              def sendEmail(from, to, subject, templateName, templateModel) {
                  emailFactory.getEmail(from, (String[])[ to ], null, null, subject, templateName, templateModel, true).send()
              }

          }

    #. Create the Freemarker template that will be used to send the verification emails to the users, under Templates >
        mail > verify-account.ftl:

        .. code-block:: html
          :linenos:

          <p>Hi ${profile.attributes.firstName}!</p>

          <p>
              Thanks for joining MySite.com. To verify your new account, click or copy the link below in your browser:<br/>
              <a href="${verificationUrl}">${verificationUrl}</a>
          </p>

          <p>
              Thanks,<br/>
              The MySite.com Team
          </p>

    #. Finally, add the controller that will perform the profile verification when the user clicks on the link included
        in the email and is redirected. If we used the code above, the script should be put in Scripts > controllers >
        verifyacct.get.groovy:

        .. code-block:: groovy
          :linenos:

          import org.craftercms.engine.exception.HttpStatusCodeException

          def token = params.token
          if (token) {
              profileService.verifyProfile(token)

              return "/templates/web/account-verified.ftl"
          } else {
              throw new HttpStatusCodeException(400, "Bad request: token param is missing")
          }

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Add Single Sign-On
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Configure SSO headers with at least a CRAFTER_secure_key, CRAFTER_username, CRAFTER_email and CRAFTER_groups (which must be a comma separated list of string) in the header, then check in Crafter Profile Admin Console to make sure
    that the Single sign-on enabled checkbox is selected in the tenant page.

    .. image:: /_static/images/sso_enabled.webp

    All headers with the ``CRAFTER_`` prefix will be mapped, without the prefix, to the attributes you defined in the
    Crafter Profile tenant, when a new user needs to be created. So the configuration above will cause the Security
    Provider to create a user with firstName, lastName and displayName attributes.

    .. note::
        For CrafterCMS versions prior to 3.1.14, the prefix for the headers is ``MELLON_`` instead of ``CRAFTER_`` and can't be changed via project configuration.

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Add Facebook Login
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    #. Be sure there's a connections attribute of Complex type defined for the project's Crafter Profile Tenant. This
        attribute is needed to store the Facebook connection info. To add this attribute to the Tenant, go to Crafter
        Profile Admin Console, select the Tenant and then add the attribute.

        .. image:: /_static/images/connections_attribute.webp

    #. Add the Facebook appSecret and appKey to your project's config (in Studio, Config > Engine Project Configuration), like this:

        .. code-block:: xml
          :linenos:

          <socialConnections>
              <facebookConnectionFactory>
                  <appId>YOUR_APP_ID</appId>
                  <appSecret>YOUR_APP_SECRET</appSecret>
              </facebookConnectionFactory>
          </socialConnections>

    #. Add a JS method that is triggered when the user clicks on the "Login with Facebook" button, that displays the FB
        login popup when the user clicks on "Connect with Facebook":

        .. code-block:: javascript
          :linenos:

          $("#connect").click(function() {
              try {
                  var top = (screen.height / 2) - (300/ 2);
                  var left = (screen.width / 2) - (500 / 2);
                  var fbDialog = window.open('/connect/facebook_dialog', 'fbDialog', 'width=500, height=300, top=' + top + ', left=' + left);
                  var interval = setInterval(function() {
                      if (fbDialog == null || fbDialog.closed) {
                          clearInterval(interval);

                          location.reload();
                      }
                  }, 1000);
              } catch(e) {}
          }

    #. Add a controller script under Scripts > controllers > connect > facebook_dialog.get.groovy, that will redirect to
        the actual Facebook login when the popup appears. The whole FB login process can be done with the help of the
        ``providerLoginSupport``, provided automatically to all scripts. The ``start(tenant, providerId, request,
        additionalParams, connectSupport)`` method is used to create the proper Facebook redirect URL. Also, by creating
        a custom ``ConnectSupport`` with a callbackUrl you can tell Facebook the URL to redirect to after the user has
        logged in.

        .. code-block:: groovy
          :linenos:

          import org.springframework.social.connect.web.ConnectSupport
          import org.springframework.util.LinkedMultiValueMap

          def connectSupport = new ConnectSupport()
              connectSupport.callbackUrl = urlTransformationService.transform("toFullUrl", "/connect/facebook")

          def additionalParams = new LinkedMultiValueMap<String, String>()
              additionalParams.add("scope", "email,public_profile")
              additionalParams.add("display", "popup")

          return "redirect:" + providerLoginSupport.start(siteContext.siteName, "facebook", request, additionalParams, connectSupport)

    #. Under Scripts > controllers > connect > facebook.get.groovy, add the script to complete the Facebook connection.
        By calling ``providerLoginSupport.complete(tenant, providerId, request)``, the login process will automatically
        be completed for you, and a new user will be created if there wasn't a previous one with the Facebook provided
        username or email.

        .. code-block:: groovy
          :linenos:

          providerLoginSupport.complete(siteContext.siteName, "facebook", request)

          return "/templates/web/fb-login-done.ftl"

The following properties allows you to configure various Login URLs:

* The ``security.login.formUrl`` property allows you to configure the URL of the login form page. The default is ``/login``.
* The ``security.login.defaultSuccessUrl`` property allows you to configure the URL to redirect to if the login was
  successful and the user couldn't be redirected to the previous page. The default is ``/``.

expression (``<expression>``) executed against the current profile. If a request matches the URL, and the
expression evaluates to false, access is denied. For more information, check
:javadoc_base_url:`UrlAccessRestrictionCheckingProcessor.java <profile/org/craftercms/security/processors/impl/UrlAccessRestrictionCheckingProcessor.html>`

""""""""""""""""""""""""
Using a Custom Blacklist
""""""""""""""""""""""""
Crafter Engine includes a default blacklist that you can find
`here <https://github.com/craftercms/engine/blob/support/4.x/src/main/resources/crafter/engine/groovy/blacklist>`__. Make sure you review the branch/tag you're using.

To use a custom blacklist follow these steps:

#. Copy the default blacklist file to your classpath, for example:

    ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/groovy/blacklist``

#. Remove or comment (adding a ``#`` at the beginning of the line) the expressions that your scripts require
#. Update the :ref:`server-config.properties <engine-configuration-files>` configuration file to load the custom blacklist:

   .. code-block:: properties
       :caption: ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties``

       # The location of the blacklist to use for all sites (this will have no effect if the sandbox is disabled)
       crafter.engine.groovy.sandbox.blacklist.path=classpath:crafter/engine/extension/groovy/blacklist

   .. note::
       In CrafterCMS v3.1.14 and prior, the name of the property is ``crafter.engine.groovy.sandbox.blacklist``

#. Restart CrafterCMS

Now you can execute the same script without any issues.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Disabling the Sandbox Blacklist
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
It is possible to disable the blacklist to allow the execution of most expressions, in
case you need to use a considerable number of the expression included in the blacklist while keeping some basic
restrictions. To disable the blacklist for all projects/sites update the server configuration file
:ref:`server-config.properties <engine-configuration-files>`:

.. code-block:: properties
  :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*

  # Indicates if the blacklist should be enabled for all sites (this will have no effect if the sandbox is disabled)

Preview Mode
""""""""""""
.. version_tag::
    :label: Since
    :version: 4.2.0

In preview mode, CrafterCMS provides a security filter that can be enabled to intercept all requests and validates the following:

- ``crafterPreview`` cookie exists
- ``crafterPreview`` cookie decrypted value contains a site name and an expiration timestamp
- Site name matches the one from ``SiteContextResolver``
- Expiration timestamp is in the future

To enable the Engine Preview Mode security filters, set ``crafter.security.preview.enabled`` to true.

.. code-block:: properties
    :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*

    #######################
    # Security Properties #
    #######################
    # If the preview security filters should be enabled
    crafter.security.preview.enabled=true

There may be some URLs that may not need filtering in Preview mode by the security filter when it is enabled.
To exclude a URL from being intercepted and validated by the security filter, add the URL to the
``crafter.security.preview.urlsToExclude`` property:

.. code-block:: properties
    :caption: *CRAFTER_HOME/bin/apache-tomcat/shared/classes/crafter/engine/extension/server-config.properties*

    crafter.security.preview.urlsToExclude=\
      /api/1/monitoring/**,\
      /api/1/site/context/**,\
      /api/1/site/cache/**

Enabling the security filter in Preview Mode requires the configuration encryption configurations (which are shared
between Studio and Engine) and admins will need to update the default configurations for the encryption key and salt in
:ref:`Studio <studio-cipher-configuration>` and in :ref:`Engine <engine-configuration-properties-encryption>`.
