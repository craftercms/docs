Content Modeling
================

Every content object in Crafter CMS is an object associated with a Content Model. Content Models allow you to add structure to your content and facilitate consumption via various visual representations or via APIs. One of the great things about Crafter CMS content models is that your content can be semi-structured which allows content authors the freedom to be as creative as they'd like to be, but provide the template/UI and API developers enough structure to produce solid multi-channel renditions of the content. This section will walk you through Content Type management in Crafter Studio to help you create the models that best fit your requirements.
