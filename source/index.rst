* Native mobile apps and headless applications (consumer mobile, IOT, digital signage, wearables, etc.)
* HTML5 websites (Freemarker templating built-in)

* and lots more (See https://craftercms.com/headless-cms-solutions/enterprise).

CrafterCMS's authoring system is built on Git and supports DevContentOps processes for content, code, and configuration. It is also a hybrid-headless, API-first (GraphQL, REST, in-process) CMS, and that allows developers to use their favorite UI frameworks and tools.

CrafterCMS differentiates itself from existing CMSs with its architecture: microservices-based, serverless, elastic and planet-wide scalability. To learn more, see the :ref:`general-architecture`.
