CrafterCMS is a modern headless+ content management platform for building digital experience applications including:

* Single Page Applications (SPAs) using frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular
* Native mobile apps and headless applications (IOT, digital signage, wearables, etc.)
* HTML5 websites using Bootstrap or other HTML frameworks
* eCommerce front-ends
* OTT video experiences on AWS Elemental Media Services
* AR/VR applications using A-Frame

CrafterCMS is a dynamic CMS based on Git and supports DevContentOps processes for code and content. It is also a hybrid-headless, API-first (GraphQL, REST, in-process) CMS, and that allows developers to use their favorite UI framework and tools.

CrafterCMS differentiates itself from other CMSs with its architecture: microservices-based, serverless, elastic and planet-wide scalability. To learn more, see the :ref:`architecture`.

This Manual introduces key concepts in CrafterCMS, presents the authoring and development environment, and provides operational and administrative considerations and procedures as well as a comprehensive reference section.
