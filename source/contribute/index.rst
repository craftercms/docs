CrafterCMS welcomes your contributions! All of our code is open source and is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/craftercms.  
CrafterCMS is written in Java and React. You can also contribute blueprints, and those can be developed in any language and just be backed by CrafterCMS for content.

To get started with making your first contribution, choose a project in GitHub and fork it.  Once you finish writing your code simply make a pull request and we'll help you though the process (review, attribution, etc) of getting your code included in to the development code line of the project.  Contributions should be accompanied by any relevant automated tests and documentation.

To learn more about contributing see: https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
