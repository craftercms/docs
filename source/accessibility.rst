=============
Accessibility
=============
Properly designed sites/projects that allows access to users regardless of any disability or limitations is
an important aspect of a good digital experience.

CrafterCMS supports web content accessibility, from creating accessible sites/projects using CrafterCMS's authoring tool,
Studio, to maintaining the sites/projects built on top of CrafterCMS.

The `Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/>`__ provides guidance on
web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. It defines
three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.

--------------
Sites/Projects
--------------
Websites, portals, applications, and other digital experiences built on top of CrafterCMS can support
`WCAG 2.1 <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/>`__ Level AA or higher. You can choose the technology that suits you best
to implement accessibility for your digital experience.

---------
Authoring
---------
The internal authoring tool, Studio version 4, is close to WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
We use **MUI** which gets you WCAG 2.1 Level AA and has components like accordions, tabs and more.

CrafterCMS is currently working on meeting WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance in Studio version 5.
