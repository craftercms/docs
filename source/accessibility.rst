Accessibility
=============
Properly designed sites/projects and applications that allow access to users regardless of any disability or limitations are
an essential aspect of a good digital experience.

CrafterCMS supports web content accessibility both in terms of the sites/projects and applications built with CrafterCMS and the authoring experience used by the content creators and managers.

The `Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/>`__ provides guidance on
web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. It defines
three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. Many government and higher education organizations require Level AA compliance.

CrafterCMS Sites/Projects
-------------------------
Websites, portals, applications, and other digital experiences built on top of CrafterCMS can support
`WCAG <https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/>`__ or other accessibility standards at any level. You can choose the technology that suits you best
to implement accessibility for your digital experience. Many libraries and technologies will accelerate this, including `MUI <https://mui.com/>`__, which supports WCAG and has UI components like accordions, tabs, and more.

Crafter Studio
--------------
Crafter Studio is the internal authoring tool of CrafterCMS. It allows content creators and managers to update sites/projects and applications. Crafter Studio version 4 is close to WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, and Crafter Studio version 5 targets WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
