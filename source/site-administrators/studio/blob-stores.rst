The Blob Stores configuration file allows you to configure 0 or more stores for assets with the corresponding information required by the store being used.

For better security and control, we recommend setting an AWS profile via the ``crafter-setenv.sh`` file instead of
configuring the encrypted credentials in the blob stores configuration file.  This allows you to have an IAM user
per developer, which is a better approach than a single user whose credentials are included (encrypted) in the
configuration file. In this way, if you need to rotate or remove the credentials of a single user, the access of
other users won't be affected.

To set an AWS profile, using your favorite editor, open ``CRAFTER_HOME/bin/crafter-setenv.sh`` and add the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AWS_PROFILE=YOUR_AWS_PROFILE

|

*where* ``YOUR_AWS_PROFILE`` is the AWS profile you wish to use for the blob store.  See :ref:`here <aws-profile-configuration>`
for more information on configuring AWS profiles.

When using an AWS profile, you can now remove the ``<credentials />`` section in your blob stores configuration file.

Remember to restart your CrafterCMS install for the changes you made to take effect.

See :ref:`publishing-assets-in-external-storage` for an example of using the blob stores configuration

-----------------------
Using AWS Service Roles
-----------------------

CrafterCMS supports AWS access without using access/secret keys, by setting AWS service roles on your machine

Simply follow the instructions here for attaching an IAM role to your instance:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#attach-iam-role

Remember to remove the ``<credentials />`` section in your blob stores configuration file.
