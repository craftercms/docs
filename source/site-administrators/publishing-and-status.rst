=====================
Publishing and Status
=====================

The **Publishing** under |projectTools| allows the user to view the publishing status, perform a bulk publish , to publish commits from sandbox repository by commit id and view the publishing queue.

.. _publishing-status:

------
Status
------

The **Status** tab allows the user to view the publishing status, such as the following:

- User status: User {username} disabled publishing for project on {datetime}
- User status: User {username} enabled publishing for project on {datetime}
- Error status: Stopped while trying to publish item: {item_path} on {datetime}
- Publishing status: Currently publishing package: {package_id} on {datetime}

It also allows the user to **Start** or **Stop** Studio publishing

Publishing is locked when content is being published.  From the Status tab, you can unlock publishing by clicking on the ``unlock`` button that is displayed during content publishing.

After clicking on the ``unlock`` button, the user will be prompted to confirm the action:

Bulk Publish
------------

The **Bulk Publish** tab allows the user to publish multiple items under the specified path.  Bulk publish should be used to publish changes made in Studio via the UI.

For example, using the Website Editorial blueprint, to publish all the articles in the year 2017, in the **Path to Publish** field, enter ``/site/website/articles/2017``.  To publish everything in your project, the user will enter ``/`` in the **Path to Publish** field

-----------------------
Publish by Commit ID(s)
-----------------------

Crafter Studio also allows the user to publish commits from sandbox repository by commit id.  Publish by commit ID(s) must be used for changes made via direct git actions against the repository or pulled from a remote repository.

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/site-config-publish-commit-id.png

	:align: center

   .. include:: /includes/git-changes-note.rst

|

To publish by commit id, let's use a project created using the Website Editorial blueprint and follow the steps below:

- Edit the Home page (/site/website/index.xm) from the command line or anywhere other than Studio
- From the command line, commit your changes

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ cd crafter-authoring/data/repos/sites/mysite/sandbox/site/website
     $ git add .
     $ git commit

- Get the commit id after doing the above step

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ git log
     commit f47c9a5bae4184e7b5ff2cb03b90b8ff86adec37 (HEAD -> master)
     Author: myuser <myuser@example.com>
     Date:   Fri Mar 15 10:09:57 2019 -0400

         edited home page outside of studio

     commit 1121d1b90d7b3131025932b6a0f0269d918caa11
     Author: admin admin <evaladmin@example.com>
     Date:   Fri Mar 15 09:31:57 2019 -0400

  The commit id we want to publish by commit id is ``f47c9a5bae4184e7b5ff2cb03b90b8ff86adec37``

- Go back to Studio and click on |projectTools| -> Publishing
- Click on the ``Publish by Commit ID(s)`` tab
- Paste the commit id from the step where we got the commit id, then click on the ``Publish`` button

.. _publishing-queue:

----------------
Publishing Queue
----------------

The **Publishing Queue** tab allows the user to see the items(publishing packages) that are in the queue for publishing.

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/site-config-publish-queue.png
    :alt: Project Tools Publishing - Publishing Queue
	:align: center

|

**Publishing packages** contains the following information:

* An ``id`` for the publishing package
* The ``environment`` item is published/to be published
* ``Username`` that sent/requested publishing package
* ``Submission comment``
* ``State`` of the publishing package
* ``Scheduled Date`` for publishing the package
* A list of file(s) contained in the publishing package with the following information:

    * The ``content type``
    * The ``content path``


.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/site-config-publishing-package.png

	:align: center

You can filter the publishing queue displayed, based on the following:

* ``Path Expression`` (e.g. simple regex ``/SOME/PATH/*``)
* ``Environment`` (a list of all available environments)
* ``State`` of the publishing packages

  The following are the applicable states to publishing packages.

    * **All**
    * **Ready for Live**: Item is scheduled and waiting in the queue to be published
    * **Processing**: Item is being published
    * **Completed**: Item has been published
    * **Cancelled**: Item has been removed from the queue (publishing was cancelled)
    * **Blocked**: Item is blocking the publishing queue

Filtering shows packages where one or more items in the package match.  The default filter is set for items that are in State ``READY_FOR_LIVE`` and Environment ``All``  which will show a list of packages that are ready to go live.

Below, we have the filter set to display items in the ``COMPLETED`` state

.. image:: /_static/images/site-admin/site-config-publish-queue-filter-completed.png

    :align: center

Packages in the ``READY_FOR_LIVE`` state can be selected and the publishing package cancelled.  In the image below, we have two publishing packages selected with the ``Cancel Selected`` button clicked and confirming if the user wants to set the state of the selected publishing packages to state ``CANCELLED``
