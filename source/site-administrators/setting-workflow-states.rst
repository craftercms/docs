Setting Workflow States
=======================

There are times when a file/item in your site gets in a state that you would want to manually correct.  Workflow States allows the user to manually set the workflow state of every file in the site.

To manually set the workflow state of a file in your site, find the file/s you'd like to change the workflow state and put a checkmark on the box next to it.  Towards the top of your browser, right next to your site name, click on **Set States**

A dialog will launch prompting you to select the state you would like to set your selection to, by clicking on the dropdown box
