Users/Groups Management
=======================

This section describes managing user accounts and groups.

A user is anybody who uses Crafter CMS.  A user account holds a user name and password.  A group consists of a collection of users.  Users can be assigned to a group for a site.  Through the groups, roles are assigned to users to certain areas of of the site (access rights/ permissions).  Each role represents a set of activities allowed.  Groups are  used to simplify management as changes made to the rights of the group applies to all the users belonging to that group.

When you work in Crafter Studio, you need to login as a user.  Your Crafter CMS administrator sets up user accounts, group memberships, roles and permissions.  The sections below goes into more detail on how users, groups, permissions and roles are administered/setup.
